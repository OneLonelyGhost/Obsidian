Haunted One- Call of the Forbidden One: It was a hot summer day, when "it" happened. Whether it was out of boredom, peer pressure or pure curiosity, you decided to try out some "forbidden" magic, thinking it wasn't a big deal, you were deadly wrong. When you practiced it, you felt darkness gripping at your soul, you felt your blood suddenly to ice, you instantly stopped and ran away. All throughout the night, you hear voices, something in your hearts od hearts know that these voices are not from this world.

Class Training Class: Warlock I became a Warlock because: I was examining a strange tome I found in an abandoned library when the entity that would become my patron suddenly appeared before me.
