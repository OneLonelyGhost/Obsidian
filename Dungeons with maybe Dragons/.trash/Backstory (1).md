## Previous Life

Working in an old library started as a way to make a living, but it ended up a way to exist in human civilisation. 
It had a downside however, my thirst for knowledge stored in old books and tomes was difficult to quench.
## Haunted Pact
It was a hot summer day, when "it" happened. 
Whether it was out of boredom, peer pressure or pure curiosity, I decided to try out some "forbidden" magic from a dusty old tome, thinking it wasn't a big deal. 
I was deadly wrong. 
From the moment I uttered the words, darkness gripped at my soul and my blood turned to ice.  Every single night forward, I heard voices, something in my heart knew that these voices were not from this world.
I was right. Drawn back to the tome, I found myself reading more and more without meaning to.
Before I knew it, I had been marked and the knowledge of The Old Ones poured into my mind. To this day, I have no clue if they know of my existence.
