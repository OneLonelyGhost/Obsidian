**Activ﻿ity 1 – IT assets**
Use stickies to list suggestions on how asset information could be captured. Give positives and negatives for each suggestion.
- using a premade ITAM and RMM software
- P: Central place to view & control all assets. keep log of activity
- C: Requires install on each asset, all assets need physically located

**Activity 2 – Hardware types**
Choose three hardware types and list the descriptors for each one in a sticky
- Laptop
	- Serial Number
	- HostName/IP
	- OS Version
	- CPU, SSD/HDD, RAM
- Desktop
	- Serial Number
	- HostName/IP
	- OS Version
	- CPU, SSD/HDD, RAM
- Server
	- Serial Number
	- HostName/IP
	- OS Version
	- CPU, SSD/HDD, RAM

**Activity 3 – Factors that could influence asset management**
Consider the five factors in the case study and give examples of what you need to consider for each factor.
- Financial
	- Employee Turnover
	- Budget
	- Penalties for mismanagement
- Security
	- Security patches
	- Employee Turnover
- Legal and compliance
	- Employee Turnover
	- Industry Standards
- Service management
	- Software support
	- Employee Turnover
- Organisational
	- Employee Turnover
	- Differing restrictions per department


**Activity 4 – Controlling IT assets**
Suggest controls that could be implemented and explain how the controls would stop unauthorised changes. As the organisation is looking to expand the scope, think about hardware and software.

Controls that could 
be implemented:
1. MFA
2. Disable devices outside company networks
3. Conditional access through AD groups
4. Externals physically attached to desks
5. Having admin users
Why it would stop 
unauthorised changes? 
1. This would ensure that users may only access the devices with which their MFA has been linked to
2. Devices would be unusable when removed from their designated location / office
3. Prevents unauthorised users from accessing files/software
4. Prevents users from moving externals (e.g monitors, docking stations)
5. Prevents users removing or installing applications or software


**Activity 5 – IT assets auditing and control**
What resources/tools can the organisation use to carry out hardware and software audits? What are the associated benefits and challenges?

- Excel Spreadsheet
	- Good for small teams
	- Can crash and open to human error
- Premade ITAM/RMM
	- Central Place
	- Activity Log
	- Expensive
	- Miss offline devices
- Power BI
	- Visualising information
	- Does not assist in obtaining information
- Physical Inventory
	- easy to spot missing numbers
	- asset tag may get ripped
- Change Request 
	- Stores requests
	- Relies on tickets
- Physical Monitoring
	- Check all assets one by one
	- Human error, staff required


**Activity 6 – The IT asset lifecycle**
Using the IT asset lifecycle diagram as a reference, describe each stage of the lifecycle for all relevant management staff.

**Planning and budgeting** 
- Asset acquisition occurs through **purchase**, **upgrade**, **replacement**, **subscription**, **leasing**, and so on.​
- IT asset planning **enables** **budgeting** **and** **acquisition** **timing** with procurement and finance.​
- Comprehensive planning should consider how the IT asset will be **acquired**, **installed**, **maintained**, **and** **utilised**. ​

**Acquisition** 
- Acquisition is triggered by an **approved** **request** **for** **procurement**.​
- If the IT asset is not available from existing inventory, **substitution** **rules** will be applied. If no suitable substitute is available, the IT asset will be acquired.​
- On completion, there should be a **verified** **proof of software or hardware** **purchase**, **licence**, **entitlement**, **or service subscription**, as well as a recorded IT asset with unique identification and other required information in the **IT asset** **register**.​
- Where applicable, the IT asset should have a recorded fixed asset tag that is cross-referenced​ in the IT asset register​.

**Assignment** 
- This step includes **assigning actions to the IT asset** (usually install, move, add, or change (IMAC) actions).
- Asset assignment is usually triggered by an **approved request for asset assignment or a detected asset information gap**.
- Monitoring provides information to support **optimal utilisation**.
- Based on this monitoring, they can create requests for procurement, asset decommissioning, or asset assignment to the service request management or change enablement practices.

**Utilisation, optimisation, and reporting** 
- **Adapting the stock of hardware and licences** to facilitate supplies. ​
- **Monitoring utilisation** for cloud assets​.
- **Tracking and assessing the potential impacts** of changes to IT assets.​
- Monitoring provides information to support **optimal utilisation**. ​
- Based on this monitoring, they can create requests for procurement, asset decommissioning, or asset assignment to the service request management or change enablement practices.

**Audit and verification** 
- Verification is a **continuous activity of identifying and correcting the gaps and deviations** between the IT asset register data and the actual IT infrastructure, or data from **IT assets, inventory, or discovery**.​
- This is a **continual process** as the actual lifecycle status is dynamic, and it ensures consistent integrity within the IT asset register. ​
- **Internal and external audits** help to​ ensure compliance with software​ agreements, electronic waste and recycling regulations, financial regulations, data and security regulatory requirements, and security policies.

**Decommission** 
- The act of retrieving and recovering IT assets from a consumer, particularly through uninstallation (including deletion of data according to relevant security policies) and deciding whether the IT assets should be returned to stock or disposed of in a predefined manner. ​
