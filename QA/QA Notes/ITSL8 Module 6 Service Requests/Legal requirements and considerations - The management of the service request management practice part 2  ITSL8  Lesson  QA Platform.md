In this module, the focus has been based on satisfying user requests. However, just because a user makes a request, this doesn’t always mean that the request is permitted within the policies of the organisation. It is the role of the service desk analyst or the support technician to establish whether the request fulfilment is permissible and achievable.

Not only does the analyst or support technician need to consider the internal policies and the application of the request, but there must also be consideration given to external legislation and international law. This may seem simple, but if the organisation is multinational, then a watchful eye needs to be kept on any changes to the law.

Most laws that impact an organisation and are relevant to service request management involve the collection, storage, and dissemination of personal data. The international laws that are especially relevant are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Freedom of Information (FOI).

### **GDPR**

GDPR is a European Union (EU) law that came into effect on 25 May 2018. It governs the way in which we can use, process, and store personal data (information about an identifiable, living person).

GDPR mainly focuses on:

- What data is stored
- How it is stored
- How long it is stored for

The laws relating to GDPR that are relevant to the service request management practice in Europe, are that personal data shall be:

- processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals (lawfulness, fairness, and transparency).
- collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (purpose limitation).
- adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (data minimisation).
- accurate, and where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (accuracy).
- kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals (storage limitation).
- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (integrity and confidentiality).

### **FOI**

FOI is only relevant to government-funded organisations and focusses on users or ‘the public’ seeking information held about themselves.

The FOI act gives you the right to request access to government-held information. This includes information they hold about you or about government policies and decisions.

This is very relevant to service request management as people seeking information using FOI are making a service request. Therefore, the support or service desk teams need to have an awareness of whether FOI impacts the organisation and if so, when they receive a FOI request, what should be done with it?

The main principle behind FOI legislation is that people have a right to know about the activities of public authorities, unless there is a good reason for them not to. This is sometimes described as a ‘presumption or assumption in favor of disclosure’.

You can normally refuse to comply with a request if it is identical or substantially similar to one you previously complied with from the same requester.

FOI requests must be made in writing, including requests made by email. It is not necessary to use a special form, or even to refer to the 2000 Act – any written request for information held by a public body could be categorised as an FOI request.

The last point is a specific reference to service request management. Users can utilise the standard service request management process to request FOI.

For more information on the FOI Act see: [Freedom of Information Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents).
