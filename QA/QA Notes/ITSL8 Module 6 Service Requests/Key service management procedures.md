## **Introduction to the key service management procedures**

Every organisation is different, and therefore every organisation has differing priorities. That said, there are a few practices and processes within any best practice framework that are common to most organisations. Change enablement, continual improvement, problem management, and service level management spring to mind.

However, the vast majority of organisations would, if questioned, immediately jump to the service desk, incident management, and service request management, or just request management as a priority.

### **Change enablement**

Change enablement is clearly an important practice as every organisation is required to change, and usually to constantly change to keep up with technology, legislation, social demands (e.g., environmental concerns or preferences), or even markets or industry sector changes. So, the management and control of changes becomes vital for the continued success, viability, and longevity (and if relevant profitability) of the organisation.

There are no fixed rules relating to what changes are, what scale, what impact, or how regularly changes should be implemented into any organisation’s work, but in best practice terms there is often talk of three ‘types’ of change.

1. **Emergency change:** A change that needs to be done urgently (or in an emergency). Something has gone significantly wrong, and a change needs to be implemented as soon as practicable.
2. **Normal change:** A change that is required to go through the change process steps that required assessment, consideration, and then authorisation to proceed.
3. **Standard change:** A pre-assessed, pre-authorised change that has been considered, and permission passed to (usually the service desk team) for them to give the final authority. For example, an organisation might state that the service desk may allow access to a data source, or change a password for a user, if they are happy and comfortable that the user is who the user the claims to be (they may have answered a series of security questions correctly).

In best practice terms, the allowing of access or changing password is a change that the service desk analyst has authorised, but the service desk team has only authorised it because that permission has been passed to them by a change authority higher in the organisation. In real terms, this is like a parent who always decides what clothing their child wears. However, as the child begins to grow up, the ‘scope of control’ is passed to them so that they are empowered to decide what clothing they wear at the weekend. As the scope of control passes, so does the responsibility for decision-making.

This is exactly how a standard change ‘could’, indeed ‘should’ be managed in an organisation. These standard changes are, however, usually recorded in the ticketing system as a service request.

### **Continual improvement**

Continual improvement is a key service management practice and process. It is at the core of everything service management. If value is the ‘ying’ then improvement is the ‘yang’; we can’t create value without continual improvement. That is not strictly true, you could create value once – instantly, but without continual improvement it is very hard to see how any organisation can continue to deliver value.

Later in this Course, time will be taken to specifically look at continual improvement, but as an introduction, the basics, every time anyone does anything, and it is meant anything then time - albeit a second, a few seconds, minutes, hours, or more - should be taken to consider: could this task, job, change, problem, or request have been done better? Could it have been done faster? And whilst not pure best practice, in reality, there is often a question of could it have been done more cheaply? 

There is also a common source of ideas, suggestions, or complaints or commendations that lead to improvements being considered, followed up, and implemented, and these come from the user community. These improvement suggestions from the user community need to be captured and recorded.

The single point of contact between the users and the service provider is the service desk, and the capturing system would be the organisation’s ticketing system. Is the idea an incident? Is it a change request? Is it a problem? No, it is none of these, and therefore is should be recorded as a service request.

### **Problem management**

Problem management is often thought of as a key practice or process within service management, and whilst the author would in no way wish to contradict this perception, it is important in the grand scheme of things to get to the cause of outages, especially those outages that cause significant or repetitive outages. However, is it more important to get the workforce, users, or customers back up and working, or whilst they are not working, work out what is causing the outage?

Of course, the perfect answer is both, but in reality, is that possible? Sometimes if there are sufficient resources it is. However, if resources are lacking then a decision needs to be made, often by those senior members of the service desk team to which takes priority. So, whilst the cause of the problem is an aim that each organisation should strive for, it doesn’t always follow that this can be achieved.

Sometimes problems may go unanswered or unresolved for a considerable length of time. However, a service request should never be left. It is too easy to forget service requests and focus on outages, but service requests have a significant, one could argue, the most significant impact on user perception. And as all should know – perception is fact.

When perception is considered, it is compared to expectation – and expectations should be clearly discussed, agreed, and monitored. This is the responsibility of the practice/process of service level management.

### **Service level management**

Therefore, the practice/process of service level management is potentially one of the most important of the practices, as it is this practice that defines and clarifies the expectations of the service from the service provider and the expectations of the customer from the service provider. It is the relationship, and the conversations between these two parties that ultimately creates a Service Level Agreement (SLA) – a ‘binding’ agreement between the two parties than is not a legally binding contract. It is, as it states, an agreement.

One example is that of a house share. Each tenant may have a contract with the landlord to pay X each month in exchange for a room or a portion of the building, but it is the agreements made with the other tenants that makes for either an enjoyable or stressful living experience. If the two parties agree and create a document of that agreement (not to be used as a weapon) simply to be used as a reference, then the relationship between the two parties should grow, become one of honesty, integrity, and cohesion.

Within the SLA will be several targets relating to resolving incidents, meeting change requirements, and in this module, most importantly, agreeing the turnaround time for assessing, addressing, and fulfilling service requests.
