Service level agreement (SLA) is a term used throughout service management. It is an agreement between the service provider and the customer relating to service levels. However, it must be noted that it is an agreement, not a contract. In best practice there is no legal element to an SLA. 

There may be a contract for delivery of the service from the service provider to the customer, but in best practice the SLA should be appended to the contract rather than be an integral part. If there is a contract between the service provider and customer, this may be a three, five, or even a ten-year contract. If anyone considers their existing position, either personally or commercially, what ‘you’ want today may not be what is required in three, five, or ten years. Things change, business demands change, personnel change. If the levels of service are within the contract, then this would require legal representatives to get involved, which would result in additional expense. 

As an agreement isn’t legal, it can change as long as both parties agree to the change.

### **Content of an SLA**

There is no best practice template for an SLA because organisations and customer requirements are different. There are many options online that provide suggested content.

Every service level manager will have their own opinion and choice for content. Here are some suggestions you may wish to consider.

#### **Document details:**

- Date created
- Date ending
- Date for review/renegotiation
- Creator
- Version number

#### **Stakeholders:**

- Customer representatives – name/role
- Service provider representatives – name/role

An organisation can choose how they notate who the signatories from both parties are. It is advised that names and roles are used rather than job titles - titles change frequently whereas a role is transferable, especially when looking at accountabilities and responsibilities.

#### **Purpose of the document:**

- The purpose of the document
- Agreed name of the service and full description of what is in scope and what is out of scope
- Any constraints, considerations, or exceptions

There needs to be clarity as to which/what services or products are and are not covered within the SLA. Any constraints, considerations, or exceptions should be clearly documented. This is all about ensuring there is no miscommunication or misunderstanding about what is within scope.

#### **Definitions:**

- Abbreviations, acronyms, and definitions

An SLA is a business-based document and best practice advises the minimal use of acronyms or technical jargon. However, there are many organisations that have their own acronyms and peculiarities. Therefore, specific jargon should be noted and explained.

There is an expectation that there will be a full glossary of terms included at the end of the document, so there is no misinterpretation from either party.

#### **Service agreement:**

- Service levels – for example, gold, silver, bronze
- Agreed priorities – what constitutes critical, urgent, P1, P2, etc.
- Response targets for incidents and service requests during and outside core hours
- Exceptions and limitations – any type or request excluded from the service provided is determined, as well as what constitutes a request and what doesn’t
- Measurements, key performance indicators (KPIs)
- What metrics, measures, and KPIs are to be recorded specific to service request management
- Reporting mechanisms, cadence of reporting, recipients
- Responsibilities relating to the reporting
- Dashboard or data access as appropriate

This is the key part of the SLA in which reporting and expected measures are documented. This is where the negotiated service level targets are discussed and agreed. Any priorities, targets, reporting cadence, style, and type are documented for clarity.

During service review meetings, a large proportion of the meeting focusses on the output from this section of the SLA.

#### **Service management:**

- Responsibilities for reporting/receiving incidents, requests, and change requests. Agreement needs to be made within the operational level agreements (OLAs) around who is taking ownership for reporting. That decision will have a direct bearing on how measures are delivered to the customer
- Responsibilities for capacity, security, and useability management
- Responsibility for onboarding and offboarding of users
- Self-service opportunities – this may be an opportunity to identify the out of hours support for service requests
- Responsibilities for communication between the customer and the service provider at strategic, tactical, and operational levels
- Service review meetings – location/cadence/attendee requirement

This section of the document details all the managerial responsibilities for both parties so that everyone is clear as to which role, and which party is doing what, when, and in what manner.

#### **Relationship management:**

Escalations, conflict resolution – what should happen in the case of a disagreement or break-down in the relationship. This is effectively like a pre-nuptial agreement in someone's personal life. Of course, no one likes to think things may go wrong. However, in business roles and personnel change, an SLA may be in place for several years - the chances of everything remaining static for that length of time is slim. People, personalities, and drivers alter, as does value definitions.

#### **Finance implications:**

Pricing, payments, incentives, penalties, etc. Just because the SLA is an agreement and not a legally binding document, doesn’t mean that financial elements cannot be included. It doesn’t have to be legally binding for service credits or penalties to be triggered. However, this is an agreement between the customer and the service provider, so there should be equality with any financial implications. If the service provider fails to deliver to the service level targets, they may be subject to a financial penalty or service credit. Financial implications could include bonus payments or uplifts if the service exceeds the targets significantly for an extended period – or whatever thresholds/payments are negotiated and agreed.

#### **References:**

- For example, service catalogue references, drafts created, and service desk tooling. The SLA is a stand-alone document, however it may reference other documents or tools, such as an entry in the service catalogue, when the document refers to tickets, calls, and records. This becomes essential when considering the reporting and measurement elements of the SLA. Where will these metrics or reports be created, stored, and/or displayed?
- It may also reference OLAs and underpinning contracts.

#### **Glossary of terms:**

There should be a detailed glossary explaining the definition of words in the document, such as:

- What is a response?
- What is restoration?
- What is ‘normal’?
- What is availability?
- What constitutes unavailability?
- What does secure mean?
- What is an incident?
- What is a request?

For example:

**What is a response?** A technician contacting a user, or a ticket being recorded?

**What is unavailability?** If one user cannot use the service, it is unavailable for that user, but is the service unavailable? How many users who cannot use the service constitutes unavailability?
