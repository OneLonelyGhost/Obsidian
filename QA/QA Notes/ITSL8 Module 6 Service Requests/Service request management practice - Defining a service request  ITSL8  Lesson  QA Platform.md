So, the service request management practice is relatively easy, but it's not the most simple. A service request is anything that's not an incident, a problem or a normal change. So, a standard change would be deemed a service request. So, my suggestion to you would be, if a user contacts the service desk, single point of contact, and says, 'Please can I,' and then whatever is the end of that sentence, then the chances are that is a service request, because if you're asking for something, then you're making a request.

If we have seen it before, it's generally low cost, low risk and the authority has already been pre-given, then it's a service request. If, however, the request needs authority, then that would be a change request. So, a service request is something that's simple, low cost, low risk and is generally made at the service desk by users. So, the vast majority of service requests are dealt with by the service desk team.

So, a service request is just anything miscellaneous that's not an incident, a problem or a normal change. And the service desk provides that communication channel for service requests, but the service request management practice is a channel for any request that's low cost, low risk and pre-authorised.
