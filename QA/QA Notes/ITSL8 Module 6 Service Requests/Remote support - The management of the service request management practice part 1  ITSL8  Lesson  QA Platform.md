In the nineteen eighties, it was considered standard practice to have an in-house IT department who dealt with requests from any business user.

In the latter part of the twentieth century, IT and organisations grew, resulting in a greater need to provide remote support.

Moving into the twenty twenties, particularly during and after the COVID pandemic, many organisations required their employees to work from home.

Because of the increase in remote working, organisations have had to consider and define how they should address user requests when support staff work remotely. Let’s take a look at some examples.

If the request is IT related, technology can be used to allow a service desk analyst or technician to take control of the user's computer for a temporary period to facilitate the request fulfilment.

### Complimentary options

A complimentary option could be to employ engineers to work remotely and out of hours to provide support on an ad hoc/on call basis. This could be extended to have the support teams based in different locations around the world. This means they could be based in the United States or Asia, but provide support to Europe as well as their own location. This service can then be replicated with the Europe-based support teams supporting the US or Asia. This option is usually only viable to larger organisations that can justify a global presence. However, what it does mean is that the support teams dealing with requests each work in their own time zone, providing support to both their own and other time zones when they are outside ‘normal’ support hours.

For medium-sized companies this maybe cost prohibitive, however they can often ‘buy-in’ a company to provide remote support for their home workers or staff outside of support hours. This service integration and management or SIAM model is now a reasonably common solution for companies striving to provide remote support without the overheads of staff recruitment, employment, onboarding, management, and development.

Both complimentary options offer remote support and have care needs taken in relation to request tickets being raised.

### Consistency

Consistency in ticket creation, triage, and knowledge sharing becomes a management overhead that needs careful thought. If not, valuable data, trends, and hidden problems may be missed, causing unnecessary downtime and lack of productivity further down the line. It is easier to enforce policies, processes, and procedures when the staff are all employed in the same company. It becomes more complicated and if those staff work in different geographical regions and speak multiple languages. It is every more complicated if the organisation has ‘bought in’ that specialism and doesn’t actively manage the workforce.
