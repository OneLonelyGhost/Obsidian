### **Your task**

Start by listing the steps you currently follow to triage a service request.

Next compare the steps you listed to the ones covered in the previous step:

1. Check the validity of the person raising the request.
2. Check that the requester is entitled to use the service related to the request being made.
3. Check that the detail of the request is clear and accurate.
4. CHECK THAT THIS REALLY IS A REQUEST – and not an incident, normal or emergency change.
5. Consider the request and define who has the ‘scope of control’ to action this.
6. Confirm the category of the request ticket.
7. Confirm the priority of the request ticket and then.
8. Either pass/escalate or provide the first element to fulfilling this request, cognoscente of the target timescale.

Now consider the following questions:

- How do your steps differ from those listed above?
- How would your organisation benefit from implementing these steps?
- How could you introduce these steps into your service request management practice?

Document your thoughts.
