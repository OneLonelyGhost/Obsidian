Whilst most service request management focuses on delivering what the user requests in a timely manner, there is a secondary activity which should simultaneously take place to satisfy user requests, and that is to recognise similarities to identify trends.

### Let’s take a look at a real-life example.

Part of a support teams' responsibility was to replace IT equipment and to issue new equipment to new starters. It was reported that the service desk was receiving several calls each week asking how to log in to the VPN on a laptop.

A decision was made to run a report on these requests and monitor how many requests were being made each week for a month. At the end of the month the report was analysed. It became clear that within three weeks of their on-boarding, virtually every new user issued with a new laptop contacted the service desk for advice regarding connecting to the VPN. The remainder of requests were from existing users.

The conclusion was that either the onboarding VPN training was inadequate, or more likely this information got lost because of the quantity of new information.

The trend was clear. New users forgot within the first month how to log into the VPN. This in best practice is a ‘proactive problem’ and needed to follow the problem management processes.

To address this issue, the team created an instruction sheet with screen captures entitled ‘How to connect to the VPN’. It was printed onto two sides of a sheet of paper and was then laminated and included in every new laptop case. It was a simple fix, but it quickly reduced the number of requests being received by the service desk.

### Service request management practice 

The service request management practice is a great way to monitor trends. It is the location where service desk staff communicate directly with users to understand their needs, and it is a portal when users can make requests.

Spotting trends or failures in faulty equipment is easy if you have a reasonable incident management process, but spotting the wants, desires, and niceties of the user communities is tricky.

You can obtain customer preferences through review meetings, but you really only get their political pick of what is needed. The users give you the extras - the nice, fluffy, simple things that fundamentally improve their user experience.

### Capturing and analysing trends 

Capturing these and analysing trends makes for a far better service delivery, far happier users and customers, and therefore greater security for the service-providing organisation.

It might seem tenuous, but it truly isn’t. It’s the little things that bring customers back. Do you go to a restaurant that brings you iced water as you sit down, or the restaurant where you sit and wait for the service and then ask for some iced water? Spot the trends, nip them in the bud, or offer them more widely, and the customers continue to use the services provided.

When users contact the service desk, monitoring trends comes down to the analyst’s intelligence and communication skills. Trends may appear from their memories (e.g., ‘This is the X call this week’) or from discussions with colleagues regarding calls they have received.

With portals or Chatbots, it is potentially a little easier as long at the request ticket structure restricts the amount of free text used and focusses users on key words or drop-down lists. These key words can then be interrogated, trends identified, and problem tickets created as a result.

Whilst it might not appear an obvious source of problems or improvement suggestions, the service request management practice is actually one of the most important for this activity.

### Deciding a course of action

There are of course times when trends are identified, but the trend is not significant enough to raise a problem or too small to be considered for an improvement suggestion. On these occasions, decisions need to be made by someone (usually the service desk, service delivery, or operations manager) as to what needs to be done with this knowledge.

Often the decision is made to watch the trend and see whether it increases or diminishes.

As a result of this decision, some mechanism needs to be created to monitor the trend. This could be physically asking someone to watch the trend, to run a manually created report, to create an automated report, or even to set up an AI machine to search for patterns within tickets referencing the trend.
