When leading a team that is predominantly responsible for the delivery of the service request practice and the processes associated with service request management, there is an additional requirement that needs to be integrated with incident management, change enablement, and to a lesser extent problem management.

It is a senior person’s responsibility to ensure that team members, subordinates, and employees are aware of these processes so that triaging of service requests becomes significantly easier.

### **What is meant by triaging service requests?**

It is believed that the word ‘triage’ was originally used in relation to medical support in the Napoleonic wars, where injured infantry were separated into one of three categories (tri):

1. Those who were unlikely to survive.
2. Those who needed medical support.
3. Those who could be patched up quickly and returned to the front line.

Triage is a word frequently used to mean ‘to assess and categorise’ which is, of course, exactly how it is actioned in Accident and Emergency or any ER department in a hospital. Let’s take a look at an example:

1. A patient enters a hospital and speaks to a receptionist (the service desk).
2. The receptionist creates an incident ticket and gives it a provisional priority e.g., chest pains – straight in to see the doctor, a sprained leg and limping – take a seat.
3. Within 30 minutes (the basic target of an ‘SLA’), the patient is triaged (incident management). This is where the ticket is reviewed and re-prioritised if required. This may mean administering pain relief, bandage or gauze, etc. (incident is closed).
4. The ticket is then re-classified as a problem ticket and the patient waits to see a doctor who will investigate the cause, make an informed diagnosis of the known error, and find a permanent fix – which might require surgery, in which case a change request is raised.

A service desk analyst should do much the same with any incident or service request. It is expected/anticipated that the analyst will:

1. Check the validity of the person raising the request.
2. Check that the requester is entitled to use the service related to the request being made.
3. Check that the detail of the request is clear and accurate.
4. Check that this really is a request – and not an incident, normal or emergency change
5. Consider the request and define who has the ‘scope of control’ to action this.
6. Confirm the category of the request ticket.
7. Confirm the priority of the request ticket.
8. Either pass/escalate or provide the first element to fulfilling this request, cognoscente of the target timescale.
