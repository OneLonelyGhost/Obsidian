It is a paradox of human life that we rarely want or need things when it is convenient. Unless you work in the hotel/hospitality industry, it is a rarity to have a team of people on standby waiting to address and fulfil any request made by a user 24 hours per day.

Dependent upon the negotiations and agreement documented in the SLA, out of hours support for service request management will vary.

### 24/7 support

In a 24/7 manufacturing organisation, managed service provider, or even emergency service support, the support for incidents, problems, and service requests may be static, and a user can get the same level of response to a request at 2am as they would at 2pm. But this tends to be unusual rather than the norm.

For most organisations, the response to service requests may be restricted to business hours with out of hours support for incidents or problems.

Those organisations fortunate enough to have AI systems, automated systems, or self-service options for service requests may be able to offer a limited-service request response out of hours. Organisations with this option can offer users the opportunity to do simple service requests such as password resets, ordering new equipment, and potentially increase capacity or add service elements on receipt of correct payments etc. For example â€“ pay as you go services, special options on streaming services, take away/out food ordering, grocery orders.

If the request has a direct income generator, then organisations are more inclined to offer out of hours service request management.

If the organisation is large enough or the user community demands that service requests should be managed 24/7, then service providers can and do provide tools or resources to allow this to happen.

### Core office hours

Many organisations generally allow service request management to function in core office hours. This becomes more challenging as businesses become more complex, larger, and the user community demands more and more from service providers. As organisations grow or move further into digital transformations, a greater emphasis is placed on technological solutions for service request management that will allow a greater span of automation, and therefore an extension of time where requests can be actioned within.

A serious consideration for any service provider is not only how they deal with service requests during office hours, but how they will address requests when support teams are not active.

This consideration links directly to the negotiation and ultimately agreement that forms the SLA. Therefore, whoever is negotiating the SLA and/or defining the customer requirement should, as a part of the discussion, ascertain the requirement for managing service requests out of core hours.
