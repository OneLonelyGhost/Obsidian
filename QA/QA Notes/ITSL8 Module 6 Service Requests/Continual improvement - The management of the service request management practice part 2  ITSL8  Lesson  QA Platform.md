Throughout this module there have been multiple references to continuous or continual improvement.

Continual improvement runs through the entire framework of best practice. Every time anyone does anything to benefit and/or support the business or the customer, thought should be given to if it was done again, how could it be done better, faster, and potentially cheaper?

**Figure 1** shows the continual improvement model, and through this Lesson there will be references to how it can be used to improve service request management.

![This diagram shows the continual improvement stages; ‘What is the vision?’; ‘Where are we now?’; ‘Where do we want to be?’; ‘How do we get there?’; ‘Take action’ and ‘Did we get there?’. To keep the momentum going the flow loops back to the first stage ‘What is the vision?’.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-43ca6868-7438-425c-8047-24ec2773b3ba.png)

**Figure 1**: Continual improvement model.

Let’s take a look at each stage in more detail.

**What is the vision?**

This stage is there to ensure that any improvements considered are going to help the organisation achieve its ultimate vision, mission, goals, and objectives. There is little point in creating a world class service request management practice if the company’s vision is to sell off the business assets, deliver the cheapest service, or to close the business in the next two years.

Before focus is placed on improving the service request management practice, it is imperative to understand exactly where the business is heading. It also ensures that any improvements are aligned to the objectives and goals of the business.

**Where are we now?**

No journey of improvement is possible without knowing your starting point. In truth, no journey is possible without knowing where you are. 

Before improvement plans for service request management can be considered, planned, or implemented, a ‘baseline’ needs to be taken so that there is a point in time that any measures can go back to, and a stated ‘situation now’ that can be compared to at any point.

**Where do we want to be?**

Once there is a clear starting point, the next stage of the journey is to identify the destination. In other words, where is service request management aiming to be in a week, a month, the next quarter, or whatever time frame the continual improvement model covers.

This is often where organisations revert to the use of SMART objectives:

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime driven

In essence, this is where clear and measurable targets are set to judge progress.

Targets should not just focus on quantitative measures, for example:

- Number of requests received
- Number of requests fulfilled
- % declined

Targets should also contain qualitative measures relating to satisfaction, time from receipt to assessment.

**How do we get there?**

Once targets have been identified, a plan needs to be formed to identify how the service request practice progresses from the baseline to the targets. This can be achieved informally or formally using whatever project best practice the organisation or team prefers. This could be a part of daily work, a sprint or timebox, or a formal project broken into stages. It is irrelevant what practice is used if there is a clearly-defined pathway taking the practice from baseline to set targets.

**Take action**

This relates to completing or journeying through the plans formed in the ‘How do we get there?’ stage. In other words, putting the plan into action!

**Did we get there?**

This stage is about benefits realisation, or achievement of targets. In the ‘Where do we want to be’ stage, targets were set. Now is the time to take a step back, look at what has been achieved, and compare this to the targets set. At this stage it is anticipated that metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) are considered and compared to the targets set. After the comparison is completed, conclusions should be made.

**How do we keep the momentum going?**

If all the targets have been met then it is important to ensure that the vision, mission, goals, and objectives are still on lesson to be delivered. 

The baseline has now been re-taken as the ‘Did we get there?’ report provided a measure of where the service request practice currently is and the ‘Where are we now?’ stage has been achieved. 

It would be inadvisable to stop developing and improving, so it makes sense to set new targets, to develop the next plan, to ‘Take action’ and then to see where you are at that point.

The model shows how continual improvement never stops.
