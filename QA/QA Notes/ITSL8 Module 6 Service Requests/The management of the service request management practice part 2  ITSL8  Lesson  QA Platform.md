## User identity management

The aim of service request management is, as you would expect, to manage service requests. The activity is a major contributor to user and customer satisfaction.

Consider being in a restaurant and your food is taking a long time to arrive due to staff shortages in the kitchen. This is liable to make you an unhappy diner. However, if the waiting staff speak with you and offer you bread, water, more drinks, or ask if there is anything else they can do for you whilst you are waiting, the waiting time is the same, but the perception of the diners towards the establishment is very different. In this situation, the waiting staff are the service desk, but they are ‘doing’ service request management’. It’s the little things that make the difference.

With that in mind, it may be perceived that a service provider should do everything they can to keep the users and customers happy. But this policy is open to abuse. Just because a user asks for something, doesn’t mean they are able to get, have, or see whatever they are requesting.

### Checks and balances

To avoid the service provider being taken for granted by the consumers there is a requirement to build in some form of checks and balance.

The usual and most obvious of these is checking that the user is entitled to receive whatever they are requesting. This can be done by comparing the user and user's role against elements within the service catalogue – so, effectively the service provider is checking that the request is within scope.

The second check is to ensure that the user making the request is the person they say they are. Here’s a real-life example of this:

In a military environment, a Private was sent to a training lesson to complete a certification to be a Major. When their ID was checked prior to taking the examination, it transpired that the actual Major was too busy to attend the lesson, so sent a Private in his place to complete the lesson for him!

It can potentially happen anywhere – from using a fake ID to buy a drink or get into a club, to using someone else’s security pass to enter a building or pass through a security door.

Checking that the user raising the request is both entitled to raise that request and is actually that user is a key activity within service request management.

### Access to information

Achieving this requires the person receiving the service request to have access to some medium-level personnel information about the consumer. The easiest way to do this is to be linked to the organisation's security system, so that any user raising a request can be located by name, title, staff number, and picture.

There is only the requirement for medium-level access to this information. More confidential information such as home address, salary, bonuses, disciplinary record dependants, and next of kin should not be available to service desk staff or the level of staff most likely to receive service requests.

If a link to personnel information is not achievable, then some form of check or authentication practice is needed. Sometimes a series of questions could be asked to gain the confidence of the request recipient and check they are who they claim to be. Often this is related to specific security questions that were set up at the time of creating a user account. Typically, users are asked some questions when creating a user account and the request recipient may ask, for example, three of the five questions. These questions are often: Maiden name of mother, first pet, first school, etc.

An alternative option is the use of a security phrase, again created by the user when setting up an account. The User ID check may then be an identified letter in a security phrase, e.g., 'What is the third, fifth, and nineth letter of your security phrase?' This is often the method used for raising a request using a self-service portal.

There are quite a few alternative options for this activity, but one thing is clear and consistent. The service provider must be confident that the requester is indeed the person they claim to be before accepting or declining the request.

### Escalation procedure

Because of this, it is essential to have some form of escalation, appeal, or ‘go again’ procedure for any user who fails the ID check. This might mean that the user has genuinely forgotten their security phrase, in which case are they allowed to create a new one, and if so, would get to raise a service request immediately or a cooling off/security checking time frame built in to ensure there is not a fraudulent change of security details. With that in mind, is there a mechanism to create a security incident as a result of a USER ID fail – if the request recipient genuinely feels that the user is pretending to be someone else, or that they have tried to enter the portal multiple times within the past x minutes/hours and consistently failed (e.g., is this a bot attempt to enter the system?)?

These may sound like you should be suspicious of people or constantly seeking hidden conspiracies - this is not the case. Many hacking operations target the softer areas of security to gain access to corporate systems. Few hackers go straight for the financial systems or customer data. They start with accessing the system and a user, looking around, and then subversively working from there.

What is easier than finding a user account, requesting a change of password, then perhaps requesting access to X system, then Y, and then finally getting to the sensitive areas they first sought. Unfortunately, it isn’t a conspiracy theory, it is modern life.

Whilst service request management might seem to be the ‘soft and fluffy’ part of supporting a service for users, it must never be forgotten it is the front line for corporate security. Therefore, User ID checking is a crucial activity for the security of the whole organisation.
