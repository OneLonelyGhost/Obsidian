If an organisation is working at its optimum, then most service requests will be addressed and either fulfilled or, if necessary, declined by the service desk because the desk has been given the ‘scope of control’ to make those decisions and/or the knowledge repository is accurate and up to date.

If the request is beyond the scope of authority or requires confirmation/support or additional authorisation, it will need to be escalated.

In addition to this, a service request is anything that is not an incident, a problem, or a normal (or emergency) change. Therefore, if a user wishes to record a compliment about the service or complaint about an interaction, then these are recorded (ticketed) as service requests.  Any compliment or complaint will almost certainly require escalation to either the service desk manager or team manager of the employee cited for praise or complaint.

In best practice, two forms of escalation are recognised, although any organisation may opt for others if they are relevant, realistic, and achievable. The types of escalation best practice recognise are:

**Hierarchic escalation**, which is used in an organisation where there is a clear managerial hierarchy or structural hierarchy. This type of structure is common in a traditional organisation and is the norm in an organisation providing services to a large populus, for example, local and national government or utility services. In a modern, small, or flat-structured organisation, finding a hierarchy may be more challenging.

**Functional escalation** is the act of passing the issue, comment, or ticket to someone with a greater understanding, knowledge, or the responsibility for the area relating to the request.

Functional escalation may relate to security or financial implications, for example, a user contacts the service desk to ask for a new user account to be set up, with the exact permissions of the users within the requester’s team. The service desk analyst could just replicate and rename a user account, but if the user’s access data is not available to everyone in the company, then the analyst might be obligated or prefer to ask the security team if they are happy about this account duplication. The security team is not hierarchically superior to the service desk analyst, they just have a different responsibility, so this would be functional escalation.

Similarly, if the request requires a budget/cost centre code then potentially the service desk analyst will contact the budget holder for authority. This is arguably moving up the organisation’s hierarchy, as budget holders are usually in the higher realms of the organisation. Whether it is considered hierarchical or functional is unimportant. The understanding that this needs to be escalated is the important factor.

### Escalating compliments and complaints

It should be obvious to all teams that any compliment or complaint should be escalated hierarchically. The service desk analyst may have the ‘scope of control’ to apologise on behalf of the service provider and to even offer credit, additional services, or something tangible as a form of compensation. However, this should not be the end of the communication chain.

It really depends on the geographical location of the users and the service provider that will influence the detailed procedures for dealing with compliments and complaints. It is a generalisation, but it is a based-on experience. 

Within the ticketing tool there should be categories for compliments, complaints, and issues raised by the user, and clear procedural direction on what escalation options are open to the recorder. This can be manually chosen, or automatically completed if the requester is using a portal, self-service, or automated system.

### Other escalation pathways

There is another type of escalation that anyone working within the service request practice needs to be aware of. It is the escalation requirements and pathways for any request ticket that either breeches the time target for assessment agreed within the SLAs, or that the fulfilment or declination of the request is not deemed acceptable by the requester.

These escalation pathways will be organisation specific. If there is a team, a role managing the service levels, a business relationship manager or team, then they may be the functional escalation for requests coming close to breaching the service level target for requests, or worse, passing the target. 

If the request fulfilment or management has not satisfactorily delivered, or the user wishes to appeal against any declination of a request, then this potentially would be escalated to the service desk manager for arbitration or secondary consideration. This type of escalation is hierarchical. 

Therefore, there is a requirement for organisations to create escalation pathways and procedures, and to document these so that it is clear for anyone in either the service desk or support team what their responsibilities and options are in relation to request escalation.

These could be referenced in the SLA, but they are more commonly held in the ‘knowledge repository’ of the service provider.

Organisations with an advanced service management tool may be able to ‘pre-programme’ escalation pathways or options into the tool itself, so that if a request closes in the resolution time target, it is automatically escalated to the correct team/individual. This means that as the ticket is be constructed, the service desk analyst can see optional escalations.
