**Once you have established asset types, you need to create models to ensure that they are dealt with consistently.** 

Lifecycle models should define the processes, controls, and procedures for the handling of IT assets based on the IT asset type. This applies to both physical and virtual/digital assets, including data and code.    

A lifecycle model is described as a detailed description of an organisation’s approach to the management of the IT asset lifecycle tailored for a specific IT asset type.  

Figure 1 shows two examples of lifecycle models.

Next to it is another asset management lifecycle – again drawn as a circle but with arrows linking across the circle to represent non-linear flow.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-11968759-20c3-46ab-b6ff-c68b432f4d98.png)

Each of the IT asset management lifecycle models should contain the following information, relating to IT asset stakeholder group (security, finance, and other management practices), as shown in Figure 2. 

- IT asset responsibility or ownership
- IT asset reporting cycle
- Services dependent on the IT asset
- IT asset utilisation, optimisation techniques, and methods
- Controls and procedures for the IT asset lifecycle stages
- Data requirements
