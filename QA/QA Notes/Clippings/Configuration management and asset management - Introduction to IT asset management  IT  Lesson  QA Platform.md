**So, what is the relationship between IT asset management and configuration management?** 

Some organisations go further than just IT asset management and will also have configuration management.  These two practices are very closely related but also have distinct differences. You can compare the differences here: 

**IT asset management** 

The purpose of IT asset management is to plan and manage the full lifecycle of all IT assets and to help the organisation to maximise value, control costs, manage risks, support decision-making about the purchase, reuse, retirement, and disposal of IT assets, and to meet regulatory and contractual requirements.  

**Service configuration management (SCM)** 

In contrast, the purpose of service configuration management is to ensure accurate and​ reliable information about the configuration of services and to ensure that the configuration items (CIs) that support them are available when and where needed. This includes information on how CIs are configured and the​ relationships between​ them.​ 

You can see that the purpose of configuration management has no mention of cost. Configuration management is all about collecting information that is important to the running/managing of a service, including the configuration of each item and relationships between them. 

IT asset management is very much financially focussed, enabling you to track your spending, maximise the value you get from your assets, and identify risks. Asset management looks at depreciation and total cost of ownership amongst other things. 

**Scope of ITAM and SCM** 

Service configuration management facilitates the availability of accurate information about CIs that must be managed in order to deliver an IT service.  

IT asset management manages the lifecycle of IT asset to support inventory control, as well as financial, security, and compliance requirements. 

The scope of the two practices also differs. Configuration management manages anything that must be managed to deliver a service, whilst IT asset management is based around inventory control and understanding what we have where, in order to manage cost/security and compliance. 

 ![The configuration management database and the asset management database hold a number of different items and components. If an item or component is both an IT asset and configuration item, it relates to both IT asset management and service configuration management.  Configuration items only relate to service configuration management and IT assets only relate to IT asset management.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-daa863b9-9b04-4f8f-8d6e-9a3bfe9ba312.png)

Figure 1 shows that the CMDB (configuration management database) and the AMDB (asset management database) will hold a number of pieces of different information.  Not all of this is stored in one place:   

- There will be items that are assets only – these could be physical or digital and could be stored in multiple databases.
- There will be items that are both an asset and a configuration item – a server would be a good example of this – we need to know about its value, but it will also be used to deliver a service.
- Then, finally, there will be items that are configuration items only – this could be a piece of information that somebody has written to help a service desk analyst resolve an incident.  You need it to manage your service, but alone it doesn’t have a financial value.
