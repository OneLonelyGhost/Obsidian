**How many different types of software licences do you know about already? There might be more than you think!** 

### Software license management 

A software licence demonstrates a legal agreement between the licensor, who is the owner or developer of the software, and the licensee, the person or organisation using the software.  It documents how the software can be distributed, accessed, and used.   Areas generally covered by software licences include the following:  

- How the software can be used
- Who owns the software
- How long you can use the software for – some agreements will be timebound and others will be indefinite
- Provisions for updates and support
- Termination

Using software without purchasing the necessary licence or using it outside the terms of the licence can lead to the organisation being fined or legal action taken against them.  This could, in the worst case, involve criminal charges, operational disruption, and reputational damage.   

Regular software audits and compliance checks should be carried out.  These will help to prevent the organisation to manage their legal and financial risks associated with unlicensed software use. In order to track and manage software an organisation will build a process for software licence management.  

Software licences are primarily in place to protect the interests of the people creating the software and the users who use the software.  One of the most important reasons they exist is to protect the intellectual property.  This defines how the software can be used and protects the copyrights of the developer or supplier.  Software licences also allow revenue generation for the developers.  By selling the licences the organisations can recover their development costs and provide ongoing support for the users of the software if required.  

Software licence management is a structured process for acquiring, using, and optimising software licences.  This allows an organisation to maximise the value of software investments and ensures compliance with licensing agreements or any other regulatory requirements.  

### Create an inventory of software assets 

The first step is to begin by creating an inventory of all the software assets that are held within the organisation. Examples of software assets include: 

- in-house built software.
- open-source software.
- commercially developed software.

Your inventory list will include software from all these sources.  

**Understand your licences**  

Understand the different types of software licences that you use.  These could be per user, per device, concurrent, and subscription based.  

**Licence procurement**  

Ensure that you implement a structured procurement process for acquiring software licences.  There should be a central repository/database where we will hold all license-related information.  This should include details about each licence.  An organisaton will store information like licence keys, when software was purchased and any licence agreements.  

**Licence checking**  

Track software licences to specific devices or users.  This means that you can then map the number of licences purchased to the number of installations or users.  You need to carry out regular compliance checks to ensure you are following the terms and conditions of the licences and also to address any noncompliance issues.  

**Licence optimisation**  

You must continually monitor your software usage to identify unused licences or under-utilised software.  This allows you to reallocate licences and, therefore, optimise your costs.  

**Documentation**  

Keep detailed records of all licence\-related transactions and activities in connection with compliance.  Provide reports to demonstrate the organisations compliance status. 

**Prepare for audits**  

Be prepared for software licence audits.  Ensure all records are up to date and accurate.  

**Security Integration**  

Ensure that licence management is integrated with security processes to ensure that software is always kept up to date and secure.  

Software licence management is an ongoing process.  It requires a combination of people, processes, and technology to ensure it works effectively.  It helps the organisation optimise their software investments whilst reducing or avoiding legal and financial risks.
