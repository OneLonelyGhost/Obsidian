**What type of reports are available and how can they be used? Here’s an explanation of how different reports can be used to support an organisation.** 

### Asset analysis and reporting 

Once an asset database has been set up and populated, it can then be interrogated to produce different reports/information for a multitude of stakeholders.  

IT asset reports are important to ensure an organisation manages and maintains its information efficiently.  Reports can provide insights into the status of an assets, where it is, who has responsibility for it, and also the usage of an asset.  

Here are some examples of IT asset reports:  

- Software inventory – a list of all installed software
- Hardware inventory – a list of all physical IT hardware assets
- Licence compliance – this will identify any unlicensed or underused software/licences
- Utilisation report – usage patterns
- Asset lifecycle report – this tracks the lifecycle of IT assets
- Security compliance – adherence to security policies and compliance with regs/legs
- Cost and budget report – an overview of costs associated with IT assets
- Decommissioning report – what was decommissioned so we can check that the correct procedures were followed.

Reports are used to help the organisation make informed decisions about things like security, the management of the infrastructure and resource allocation.  They ensure that IT assets are being utilised efficiently and effectively to provide the best value to the business and to ensure we support the business objectives.  

**Using the reports**  

The reports will provide valuable information for a number of different teams/departments when making decisions.  Below are some examples of how the reports could be used:  

**Inventory reports –** these provide information on all of the hardware and software assets within an organisation.  They allow you to track what assets are currently in use, where they are and the state of them.  

**Compliance reports –** These allow organisations to track their software installations and ensure they are compliant with licences.  These reports can prevent legal and financial issues due to non-compliance.  

**Resource allocation reports –** These help allocate IT resources effectively.  If we know the use of an asset and what status it is in then we can make decisions about when to purchase new equipment, what equipment we can reallocate and when to retire assets. 

**Cost management reports –** These can provide information of costs associated with IT assets. This can include the original purchase cost, any maintenance costs and the depreciation of an asset.  This information will help us with cost optimisation.  

**Incident and requests –** These report on incidents and service requests associated with assets allowing organisations to identify common issues, measure things like response times for different asset types and, therefore, identify improvements for the service desk. 

**Budgeting and financial reports –** These help an organisation make decisions on future IT expenses and allow us to understand our current ongoing expenditure.
