Here you will find a list of some of the popular tools available to monitor your licensing situation. Some monitor specific products whilst others can interface with a number of different sources of software.  You’ll dive deeper into these tools by completing this activity. 

### Your task 

The following list includes a selection of available tools. There are of course many more to choose from, which you can find for yourself online. 

- Snow License Manager
- IBM License Metric Tool
- Microsoft SAM Tool
- ManageEngine Desktop Central
- SolarWinds License Manager
- Cherwell Asset Management
- ServiceNow Software Asset Management
- Opensource SAM Tool

- Choose three of these tools to research. Find out about their features and how they can be used in relation to software licensing.
- Next, find out which tools your organisation uses, adding them to the list if they are not already on there.
- Research how these tools are used in your organisation to keep your licence situation compliant.

To complete this task, you will need to carry out research online and within your organisation. Speaking to the people in your organisation who are responsible for these tools could be a good source of information.  

Keep a note of your research to refer to later in the workplace. 

**You should spend no more than 45 minutes on this activity.**
