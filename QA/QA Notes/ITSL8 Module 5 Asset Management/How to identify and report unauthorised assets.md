**How can you mitigate potential security risks, unauthorised access attempts, and even data breaches? Find out more here about the continual process that’s required to achieve this.** 

Let’s start by looking at some examples of how an organisation can identify unauthorised IT assets:  

- **Asset management software** – This can automatically discover all connected devices on the network and compare them against the inventory an organisation holds.
- **Network monitoring** – This can scan your network on a regular basis to identify any new devices attached and highlight those which have not been given authorisation for installation.
- **Periodic audits** – These can be scheduled or unscheduled.  They can be physical, or you can use automated auditing tools that scan the network and identify devices and software not on your authorised IT inventory.
- **Incident/s****ervice request logging** – The service desk will check user details when logging a record including the IT asset that the call is being logged for, therefore, identifying any anomalies on a day-to-day basis.
- **Collaboration** – encourage employees to report any suspicious or unauthorised IT assets.  Ensure that there is a method for these to be recorded that is confidential if required.

The process of detecting unauthorised IT assets is continual.  It requires continuous monitoring and having effective policies and procedures in place and agreed.  As new technologies and challenges emerge, the asset detection approach needs to be regularly reviewed and updated.  

Once an unauthorised asset has been identified, it is crucial it is promptly reported to the correct resource for action.  Reporting unauthorised IT assets is critical if an organisation is to maintain the integrity of its IT environment.  Identifying and reporting unauthorised IT assets helps mitigate potential security risks, attempted unauthorised access, or data breaches.  

How these are actioned will depend on your own organisation’s procedures. Some examples can be seen here:  

- The service desk identifies an anomaly whilst logging an incident.
- The service desk can amend the IT asset dependant on agreed policy.
- IT asset management software identifies unauthorised devices on the network.
- Notification is sent to the IT department which will investigate further and, if relevant, will add these devices to the IT asset register.
- Scanning software detects unlicensed software.
- Notification is sent to the resource responsible for software licensing and investigations take place to identify if more licences need to be purchased or if the software needs to be removed.

By reporting these discrepancies, it allows IT to further investigate and act on the information ensuring you keep your environment safe, secure, and running efficiently.
