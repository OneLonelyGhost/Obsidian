Data has become the most important IT asset in many organisations for daily operational and decision-making activities. Security, control, and protection of data, and its inclusion in continuity and recovery planning, is fundamental.   

This can be achieved by:  

- managing the IT assets that contain data.
- applying ITAM and information security procedures to this data to protect it and control its lifecycle.
- implementing a data management practice.
