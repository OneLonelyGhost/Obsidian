**From Microsoft Intune to chocolatey — yes, you have read that correctly! There’s a lot to think about when it comes to installing software licences.** 

To install licences, both directly and remotely to end\-user devices, you will typically need a software distribution and deployment solution or a mobile device management system.  Which you use will depend on the devices, and the software, you are installing. 

Here are some examples of these tools: 

**Software distribution and deployment tools**  

Microsoft SCCM – This is a powerful tool for managing software deployments on Windows devices.  This tool allows you to remotely deploy software, including their licences, as long as the devices are within your network.  

Group policy – In a Windows environment, you can use group policy to deploy software to Windows devices.  This can handle basic software deployments and licence installations. 

Third\-party deployment tools – There are lots of third-party deployment tools available such as chocolatey, PDQ Deploy,  and ManageEngine.  

**Mobile device management**  

Smartphones, tablets, and any other mobile devices, generally use a mobile device management solution to deploy software and licences. Some examples of these are VMware Workspace ONE and Microsoft Intune.  

There is a general process for remotely and directly installing software and licences.  This should be followed regardless of whether the software is developed internally or purchased from a third party.  This allows for consistency and ensures that software licence management is kept up to date. This general process includes:  

- preparing the licence package.
- ensuring that you have the licence key ready for deployment.
- choosing a deployment method.
- choosing the appropriate deployment method.  This will depend on your environment and the devices you are deploying to.  You could deploy using a big bang method or maybe a phased approach.
- preparing the deployment packages.
- configuring the deployment package in your chosen deployment tool.
- targeting devices.
- identifying the devices where you want to install the software licences.
- deploying the licences.
- starting the deployment process, and this will then remotely install the software licences onto the identified devices.
- monitoring and verifying.
- ensuring the process completes successfully and that the licences have been installed correctly.
