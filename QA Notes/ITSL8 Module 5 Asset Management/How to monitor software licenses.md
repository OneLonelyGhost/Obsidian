### How to monitor and track software licensing to maintain compliance  

There are a number of software tools and solutions that you can utilise to monitor your software licensing situation.  These include solutions designed specifically for software licence management and software asset management.  The tools can automate and streamline the process of tracking, monitoring, managing, and optimising your license position.    

These tools are referred to as Software Asset Management (SAM) tools.  They work by initially collecting data around an organisation’s software assets and then going on to analyse that data to help an organisation get the best use from their software and manage costs.  There are a number of different activities a tool can perform, including the following: 

- **Scanning the environment:** The first step is for the tool to scan the organisation’s environment and identify and capture all of its installed software.
- **Collecting data in relation to software licences:** This includes things like licence keys and purchase information.  Some of this information will come from procurement records, whilst other information will need to be input manually.
- **Reconciling of installed software against licences:** The tool will reconcile what you have actually installed against the available licences.  It will check to ensure that the number of instances of software do not exceed purchased licences.
- **Pro-active generation of issues:**  Notifications can be generated if compliance issues are identified.
- **Helping to prepare organisations for a software audit:** This includes maintaining accurate records, generating reports, and producing relevant compliance documentation.

In the next step, you’ll complete an activity, which relates to some of the popular tools available to monitor your licensing situation.
