**So, how can you track the journey of an IT asset? The IT asset lifecycle explains the different stages an asset passes through.** 

There are various stages that an IT asset can travel through— from planning the asset, all the way through to disposal of the asset.  These stages are represented by permitted statuses. 

Different asset types can be assigned different statuses. As an asset moves through its lifecycle, the status will change to represent where it is at on its journey.  Figure 1 shows a typical lifecycle of an IT asset — from planning and budgeting, acquisition, assignment, utilisation, optimisation and reporting, audit and verification, decommissioning, through to disposal.   

**Note: Not all the statuses will be used on every journey.**

### IT asset lifecycle: Nonlinear nature

Figure 2: The IT asset lifecycle has a nonlinear nature 

As shown in Figure 2, the IT asset lifecycle has a non-linear nature and must not be defined as linear or unidirectional. 

For example:  

- An IT asset with minimal cost and risk may require little to no planning and budgeting, reporting, or auditing.
- IT assets may be reassigned multiple times throughout their useful life.
- A decommissioned IT asset may be placed on legal hold for an extended period before it is disposed or reassigned.

**Planning and budgeting** 

- Asset acquisition occurs through **purchase**, **upgrade**, **replacement**, **subscription**, **leasing**, and so on.​
- IT asset planning **enables** **budgeting** **and** **acquisition** **timing** with procurement and finance.​
- Comprehensive planning should consider how the IT asset will be **acquired**, **installed**, **maintained**, **and** **utilised**. ​

**Acquisition** 

- Acquisition is triggered by an **approved** **request** **for** **procurement**.​
- If the IT asset is not available from existing inventory, **substitution** **rules** will be applied. If no suitable substitute is available, the IT asset will be acquired.​
- On completion, there should be a **verified** **proof of software or hardware** **purchase**, **licence**, **entitlement**, **or service subscription**, as well as a recorded IT asset with unique identification and other required information in the **IT asset** **register**.​
- Where applicable, the IT asset should have a recorded fixed asset tag that is cross-referenced​ in the IT asset register​.

**Assignment** 

- This step includes **assigning actions to the IT asset** (usually install, move, add, or change (IMAC) actions).
- Asset assignment is usually triggered by an **approved request for asset assignment or a detected asset information gap**.
- Monitoring provides information to support **optimal utilisation**.
- Based on this monitoring, they can create requests for procurement, asset decommissioning, or asset assignment to the service request management or change enablement practices.

**Utilisation, optimisation, and reporting** 

- **Adapting the stock of hardware and licences** to facilitate supplies. ​
- **Monitoring utilisation** for cloud assets​.
- **Tracking and assessing the potential impacts** of changes to IT assets.​
- Monitoring provides information to support **optimal utilisation**. ​
- Based on this monitoring, they can create requests for procurement, asset decommissioning, or asset assignment to the service request management or change enablement practices.

**Audit and verification** 

- Verification is a **continuous activity of identifying and correcting the gaps and deviations** between the IT asset register data and the actual IT infrastructure, or data from **IT assets, inventory, or discovery**.​
- This is a **continual process** as the actual lifecycle status is dynamic, and it ensures consistent integrity within the IT asset register. ​
- **Internal and external audits** help to​ ensure compliance with software​ agreements, electronic waste and recycling regulations, financial regulations, data and security regulatory requirements, and security policies.

**Decommission** 

- The act of retrieving and recovering IT assets from a consumer, particularly through uninstallation (including deletion of data according to relevant security policies) and deciding whether the IT assets should be returned to stock or disposed of in a predefined manner. ​
