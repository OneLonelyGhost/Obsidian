**Why is categorisation of assets important?**  

Categorising an asset is a fundamental part of the asset management process. It involves organising assets based on various criteria. This helps the organisation to track, manage, and make informed decisions around their assets.    

How assets are categorised will vary depending on the needs of the organisation and the industry that it works in. Categorisation of assets is essential for asset management and helps with cost control and decision-making. It also assists an organisation in allocating resources appropriately and maximising the value of their assets. 

Figure 1 shows the IT asset types of [[hardware]], [[software]], [[cloud services]], [[code]], and [[data]]. 

![IT asset types are [hardware], [[[[software]]]], [[cloud services]], [[[[code]]]], and [[[[data]]]]](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-dbed51c0-b0ce-4202-8d6f-4b6e6a442528.png)

Figure 1: IT asset types  

Let’s take a look at each of these in more detail. 

### [[hardware]] 

- End-user devices - personal computers, tablets, smartphones, and SIM cards
- [[Data]] centre [[hardware]] - servers, storage, and backup systems, and uninterruptible power supplies
- Physical security equipment and devices, including cameras and physical access technologies
- Network and telecom equipment - routers, switches, load balancers, and video-conferencing and voice-over Internet protocol systems
- Business technology - Internet of Things (IoT) devices and industry-specific technology (such as ATMs in banking, PLCs in manufacturing), and audio/visual equipment
- Significant peripherals - personal printers, monitors, scanners, and multifunction printing systems

### [[Software]] 

[[Software]] running on [[hardware]] and virtual machines in all environments (development/integration, test, staging, live/production, training), such as:  

- Operating systems
- Middleware, such as web servers, SSL certificates, enterprise service buses, and database access services
- Personal and server applications

### IT [[cloud services]] 

[[Cloud services]] that are increasingly replacing [[hardware]] and some [[software]] (depending on the service model), including:  

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- [[Software]] as a service (SaaS)

### [[Code]] 

[[Code]], whether created through traditional application development activities or used to modify IT assets, such as infrastructure as [[code]] (IaC), is a strategic technology investment and may be treated as an IT asset unto itself.  

### [[Data]] 

[[Data]] has become the most important IT asset in many organisations for daily operational and decision-making activities. Security, control, and protection of [[data]], and its inclusion in continuity and recovery planning, is fundamental.   

This can be achieved by:  

- managing the IT assets that contain [[data]].
- applying ITAM and information security procedures to this [[data]] to protect it and control its lifecycle.
- implementing a [[data]] management practice.
