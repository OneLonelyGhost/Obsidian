**Where do you start with scoping IT asset management? What should you consider? Here, you’ll find out about some of the factors that will help your decision-making.** 

There are several high-level factors that could have an impact on your decisions around the scoping of IT asset management. These include the following points: 

**Financial** 

- The financial benefits we get from IT assets
- Accounting for costs
- Financial impact of losing an IT asset
- Total cost of ownership fines/penalties for mismanagement

**Security** 

- Understanding the risk and vulnerabilities associated with IT assets
- Evaluating both direct and indirect losses

**Legal and compliance** 

- Industry regulations
- Local legislation
- Contractual obligations with suppliers
- Audit and compliance requirements

**Service management** 

- What services will be supported by IT asset management?

**Organisational** 

- Which divisions/departments will be included?

Now that you’ve been introduced to the factors that could impact scoping, let’s take a look at the outcomes of asset management. 

### The outcomes of asset management 

For the chosen types of IT assets, the IT asset management (ITAM) practice maintains and provides many outcomes. These outcomes include the following: 

- IT asset lifecycle integration with other practices to achieve greater efficiency and cost effectiveness
- Understanding of the key attributes of asset choices in areas such as sustainability and warranty
- Coordination with suppliers or partners that provide or manage specific assets or types of assets
- Appropriate handling of IT assets, in accordance with policies and regulations, and considering applicable costs and risks
- Trustworthy data about what the organisation must support and manage

### IT asset management implementation 

Taking on IT asset management for the first time in an organisation can be a huge task. 

Generally, organisations do not attempt to manage everything with a **big bang** implementation but rather take on board a more progressive approach.  This is where you would make decisions about what will be collected, where/who will this cover, and how you will manage it.   

Once you have established your first phase of the project, you can then incorporate more information, learning from your previous implementation experience.  Figure 1 shows some of the things you can consider.

Figure 1: The scope of your IT asset management implementation 

Here's a summary of the scope of your IT asset management implementation: 

**What?** IT assets to be managed include software, hardware, cloud services, associated services such as maintenance and support, and corresponding IT and organisational asset data. 

**Where?** Parts of the organisation concerned include countries, regions, sites, business units, IT departments, service desk, procurement, finance/accounting department, and external service providers, such as contractors. 

**How?** Process activities carried out with related policies and corresponding roles and responsibilities include the following: 

- To acquire and maintain complete and accurate data
- To achieve integration with other practices
- To optimise IT asset-related costs and risks
- To adapt to the dynamic needs of the organisation

You’ll now move on to explore categorisation of assets.
