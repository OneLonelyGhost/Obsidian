Reflecting on the best practices you have learnt so far, interview two managers involved in a completed digital technology initiative in your organisation and ask them to give examples of how risks were identified and mitigated for during the programme. 

As part of interviewing the two managers, capture the following: 

- When and how during the initiative was risk identification work planned for?
- When risks were identified, what criteria was used to quantify and set a priority against each risk?
- How did the digital initiative programme activities plan to manage risk?

Once you have completed this task keep your report safe. At the end of this Learning Path you will need to collate all the reports you have created into one document and then upload them into Bud.

In the next step you will test your learning and understanding by completing a Knowledge Check. Once completed, you will then move on to the next Lesson where you will explore the key benefits of implementing a digital transformation.
