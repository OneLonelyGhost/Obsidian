The next level down is the event level process modelling which looks at the processes

### **Model Versions** 

Process models may be required for many different purposes, among them modelling the as-is business processes.  

- **As-is:** models the way the process currently works. This presupposes that the process exists and has already been identified.
- **Should-be:** this is the way we would ideally like the process to work, based on strategy, value chain analysis etc.
- **Could-be:** especially in process re-design. Often from ‘blue-sky’ thinking to foster some creative thoughts on the process configuration.
- **To-be:** this is the way we design the process to work in the near future. What versions are required in a project will depend on the extent of the business change being made.

If processes are already defined, then as-is process modelling will be based on those definitions. If existing processes have not already been defined, we can capture the current activities and group them into processes on a provisional basis. Care should be taken when modelling as-is not to stray into the should-be; as-is modelling shows us what is happening, whether that makes sense or not. 

### **Process Elements** 

For all business processes we need to document the following important process elements: 

- Business events that trigger the process.
- Actors involved in the task.
- Tasks carried out by the actors.
- Rules that underpin the process.
- Process customer.
- Outcomes from the process.

**Business Events** 

Processes are triggered by events. An event will trigger an action in the business. These may be of three types: 

Internal Event:  

- Generated within the scope of our business.
- Hence, we do control the origin of the event.

External Event:  

- Generated outside the scope of our business.
- We don’t control the origin of the event.

Time based:  

- The occurrence of a date / time.

What events might we need to consider for our At Home cinema? 

### **At Home cinema – Event triggers** 

1.

**Process**: Promote film 

**Event:** Film scheduled 

**Event type:** Internal 

2.

**Process:** Sell ticket 

**Event:** Customer wants to see a film 

**Event type:** External 

3.

**Process:** Screen film 

**Event:** Film start time 

**Event type:** Time based 

We now have a better understanding of the processes and how they start. This allows us to confirm the sequence and dependencies.  

### **Actors** 

Actors, or roles, represent sets of responsibilities and perform activities (tasks, steps) within a process. Actors represent people, groups of people or even other business or IT systems. Usually there is more than one actor involved in a process. Actors become swim lanes in process models. 

### **Tasks** 

A task is something done by one actor in one place at one time: 

- One Actor 
- If the actor hands off to another actor, it is the end of the task.
- One Place 
- If the work moves to a different physical location, it is the end of the task.
- One Time 
- If the actor stops doing the work to wait for something else to happen or for a point in time, it is the end of the task.

### **Identifying Tasks** 

We can identify the tasks by: 

- Observing the process actors and noting what they do
- Meeting with the actors, individually or in groups, and asking what the tasks are.

### **Business Rules**  

Processes need rules. 

To guide the logic of the execution of the process  

- To define how to link up the activities.
- To enable decisions to be taken, e.g., up to what age do child tickets apply?

Rules are created because of: 

- External Constraints, e.g., legislation
- Best practice
- Experience
- Organisation policy
- Operational guidance.

### **Process customer** 

The customer of a process is the entity that directly benefits from (or is a victim of!) the process and often uses the output for some purpose. The customer might be internal or external and is sometimes called the “beneficiary”.  

There may be more than one customer, though the main customer tends to be the one who has requested the product or service. 

### **Outcomes and Outputs** 

You may come across the terms “outcome”, “output”, or “process goal”. Unfortunately, there is no universal agreement on these terms.  

- Often “outcome” is synonymous with “output”, but sometimes “output” is distinct from “outcome”.
- The term “process goal” is sometimes used in place of either or both!
- We will use outcome to mean the effect of the process, not the output itself:
- Outcome: the effect that the process has, or should have, on the interested stakeholders (how the customer benefits).
- Output: the product / service directly produced by the execution of the process.

For a library process “Add member” 

- Outcome: Member can use library facilities

- Output: Membership recorded; Membership card issued.

### **At Home cinema – Outcome versus Output** 

1.

**Process:** Promote film 

**Outcome:** Film promoted – film screen times communicated to customers 

**Output:**

- Ad on TV
- Website lists film show times

2.

**Process:** Sell ticket 

**Outcome:**

- Ticket sold – the customer has a seat at the screening of their choosing.

Or 

- Ticket sold – At Home cinema has received payment for the ticket.

**Output:**

- Booking recorded on the sales system
- Printed ticket

3.

**Process:** Screen film 

**Outcome:** Film screened – customer has been entertained 

**Output:** Digital movie files read 

 In this next step you will explore relationships between the processes.
