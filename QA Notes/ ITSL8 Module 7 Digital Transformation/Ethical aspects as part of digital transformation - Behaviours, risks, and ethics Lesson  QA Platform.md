The impact of digital technology not just in organisations but in society is ever evolving and increasingly having both beneficial but also potentially damaging consequences if it’s not managed carefully. 

It’s important, in the digital economy, with organisations using digital transformation to become increasingly competitive, that those same organisations still consider the ethical consequences of how they apply that digital technology and not just focus on its economic benefits. 

For example, In recent years machine learning has often been prone to being trained with datasets that are often subject to inbuilt biases e.g. facial recognition technology that showed inaccuracies in gender identification dependent on a person’s skin colour. Organisations have a responsibility to behave ethically in order to understand and correct such biases. 

### **Importance of ethics** 

The constant and increasing influence and dependence on digital technology impacts ever more across every society and organisation. Despite best efforts, the impacts positive but also negative of this dependence and use of digital technology cannot always be reliably foreseen given how fast moving and complex the usage is. It’s important therefore as part of digital transformations that the ethics and moral consequences of increased use of digital technology are incorporated into the digital transformation programmes considerations both at a management level but also practicably as part of day to day programme activity. 

### **Education** 

As part of enabling digital transformation to organisations which will result in the organisational activities often being done in a significantly different way it’s important to ensure that education about ethics must be included as part of the overall organisational change activities. Digital change leaders need to ensure that they are consistently measuring and monitoring attitudes of staff to demonstrating appropriate ethical behaviours since just expecting staff to always “do the right thing” can’t be just trusted to the use of rules and managing compliance against them. 

Best practice recommends planning and hosting a series of workshops to be used to enable staff to be aware of ethical consequences of the transformation activities they are involved in. As part of these workshops opportunities to discuss scenarios and attitudes to ethical consequences of the transformation can have a spotlight put on them in a relaxed manner. By using a variety of education activity this will enable and encourage all staff to see the wider picture, beyond of the direct individual workstreams that they are involved in and to better foresee consequences both intended and unintended to the transformation activity. Even at a practical day-to-day level, conversations around ethics can be brought in to sprint retrospectives and lessons-learned activity. 

Through the use of the education focus around ethics this will help to build aspects of an appropriate culture in the organisation that is not just solely focused on quality and the customer experience but also able to look beyond those horizons. 

### **Organisational considerations** 

The way organisations are structured can also be altered to as part of a digital transformation to increase trust between team members, enabling an increased focus on collaboration. It’s important to consider organisational structure at several points both before, during and after transformations. The deliberate act of ensuring an appropriately diverse workforce that is effectively able to work and communicate easily with each other will build trust across the organisation contributing to good ethical behaviours propagating widely around the organisation. Through this it will build an organisational culture of people interactions occurring within which unethical activity is less likely to occur. 

### **Ethical habits**  

It’s important that digital leaders of the transformation programme demonstrate and encourage all staff to use good habits to embed behaviours that will mitigate the potential for unethical activity to occur as a consequence of the transformation work. The education and organisational structure aspects if done successfully will ensure an environment is created in which the appropriate habits will occur naturally and mitigate unethical activity occurring in the first place. 

It is important to always reflect off failures since this will gain more learning to the organisation than just reviewing success from the initiatives. The learning to be gained from evaluating ethical failures as a consequence of a digital initiative needs to be back by a strong “no-blame” culture otherwise the danger is the same mistakes will occur again. 

When considering ethical aspects as a consequence of digital transformation, the following behaviours are useful: 

- Get digital leaders to define ethical principles to give better clarity to all teams involved.
- Understand that there is not always going to be a perfect solution with no unintended consequences – map out and try to always steer towards activity and decisions that are agreed to be the least negative.
- Consider not just your own actions but also how they might also affect others.
- Be open and discuss ethical dilemmas.
