Let's now look at the Enterprise level: Value stream in more detail by exploring the top-down approach.

This is highlighted. 1 = Enterprise Level: Value Stream. 2 = Event-response Level: Process flow. 3 = Actor-task Level: Procedural.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-8f97e9e5-2fc2-42b4-b00f-e5d77c2710b0.png)

### **Top-Down Approach** 

The temptation is to dive into the detail of a process and fix it. This may occur because of a lack of time, budget, or even understanding of the need to ascertain what is causing the issue in the first place (often referred to as the root cause). This approach can also result in a lack of understanding about the way the organisation is structured and what other external factors we should consider. 

Once we have the context through examination of the internal, external, and structural aspects of our organisation, we need to understand what work is important to achieve the results that the organisation requires to be successful. 

An enterprise view of processes allows us to see the core areas of work that deliver a product or service to the customer without becoming overwhelmed with the details of each process. 

We can use the map of the London Underground as an example: we can see the entire network, which stations are on which lines, where the lines intersect, and alternative routes to our destination. We can use it to plan how to get from A to B without worrying about exactly where the lines run in real life. It gives us enough information to allow us to meet the specific goal we have.  

The model that we then form will provide a more detailed, specific view of an area of interest, perhaps the actual physical layout, depth, and signal points on a track allowing us to carry out maintenance work. 

An enterprise level process model therefore: 

- Helps define the boundaries of each process and the overall boundary of our organisation, or the part of the organisation that we need to examine.
- Defines the ‘lie of the land’; i.e., we can ‘see’ the entire landscape, rather than the specific details.
- Establishes where we need to deliver something of value to the customer, either via individual processes or as a whole.
- Confirms cross functional relationships.
- Confirms the inputs, outputs, and information that allow us to dive into the detail.
- Informs our decisions: helping us focus on an area of interest.
