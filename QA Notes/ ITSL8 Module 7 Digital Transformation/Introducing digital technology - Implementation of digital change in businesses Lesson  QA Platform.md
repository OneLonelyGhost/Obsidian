Organisations will often introduce digital technology as a way of improving an individual business process or activity. This type of change will happen over time, and it’s best practice to manage and introduce digital technology as part of a broader holistic digital transformation programme and strategy. 

Whatever the particular organisational context, there are five main areas that need to be considered as part of a digital transformation programme:

#### 1\. Business unit or product strategy

Strategies that involve the use of digital technology will cover different parts of the organisation. These will usually be defined as part of the enterprise digital strategy.

As part of best practice, it’s important to ensure that **all** these initiatives are aligned to the enterprise strategy and associated budget. If this isn’t done, it’s likely too many poorly coordinated digital technologies will be inconsistently applied across the organisation, causing cost, risk, and other issues.  

#### 2\. Individual stakeholders

Employees, contractors, and suppliers often use their own devices to complete work. Consumers of the organisation’s services also use other technologies to engage with various products and services provided to them. technology represents a potentially better way for the organisation to meet its objectives. Taking time to understand the perspective of each stakeholder and what technology they use will help to inform your digital transformation programme. 

#### 3\. IT strategy

IT strategies are often developed by organisation’s IT service provider and must consider all the IT technologies used by the organisation.

It is best practise to include all digital technologies being procured across the whole business not just the ones procured by the IT service provider. You can then check that all IT strategies are aligned.

#### 4\. Operational optimisation

Operational challenges constantly occur within organisations, and it’s often these challenges that result in new digital technologies being introduced to overcome them. Whilst individual operational changes don’t fundamentally change the operating model of the organisation, minor changes quickly add up into significant change. Digital leaders need to recognise this, and transformation programmes need to encompass both smaller operational initiatives, as well as entirely new areas where digital technologies fundamentally change the organisation’s operating model.

#### 5\. Digital strategy

A successful digital strategy needs to focus on all aspects of the organisation’s business and how the business operates. By doing this, it will enable a consistent approach to digital transformation.

In summary, a successful digital transformation programme will inevitably lead to many unforeseen changes. This shouldn’t be seen as a negative, as it will spur innovations that will improve the organisation’s performance at a faster rate. The challenge is to ensure coordination is maintained by the leaders across all initiatives to ensure the organisation works towards a single vision.

The importance of this single vision and strategy can’t be overemphasised. If there is no clearly defined digital strategy, but rather a set of loosely formed digital technology initiatives, these initiatives should be paused while a proper digital strategy is defined.
