## Behaviours in digital technology transformations

There are five main behaviours that will be most relevant for professionals to demonstrate and keep demonstrating as part of successful digital transformation activities. 

These are: 

- Always think ‘customer first’.
- Develop trust.
- Keep ahead of expectations.
- Embrace uncertainty.
- Continual improvement and learning.

The promotion and continual demonstration of these behaviours by the leaders of the digital transformation will help the organisation transform. Encouraging people and teams to embrace these behaviours will be crucial to enable progress to be effectively made in any organisation towards becoming a successful digital organisation and to realise the objectives and vision of the organisation. 

### **Always think ‘customer first’** 

This behaviour focuses on the act of continually striving across every product or service of an organisation to put customer experience uppermost in staff and teams’ considerations. Every product service or even action that directly interacts with the customers is fundamental to contributing towards the core principle of this behaviour that you are addressing the customer needs and problems. Demonstrating this behaviour requires the ability of staff and teams to want to “Take the customer journey” … i.e. how does it feel to the customer both before, during, and after using the digital products and services.  

### **Develop trust**  

Developing trust is a crucial behaviour as part of digital transformation efforts since many decisions will need to be taken at all levels in the organisation and it’s important that people and teams are trusted to make those decisions based off their professional understandings. This behaviour also supports into aspects of a safety culture where all people are encouraged to share their knowledge and views rather than being afraid to speak with no blame attached to what they communicate. This will enable less experienced staff to validly voice their views and give input as much as more experienced staff to feel comfortable when asking for help. 

### **Keep ahead of expectations** 

This behaviour focuses on never being satisfied with the current capability, with the stance that even if stakeholders are satisfied at the moment, it’s increasingly likely they will not be tomorrow. Customers will always look more positively on an organisation if they demonstrate a proactive approach to initiating improvements. As part of demonstrating this behaviour encourage all teams to spot and log improvement opportunities and then actively discuss and follow up on them. 

### **Embrace uncertainty** 

In an increasingly digital organisation there will be increased uncertainty often as a consequence of the increased pace of business change. This behaviour is about encouraging people and teams to use experimentation and not be afraid to fail.  More unknowns will occur as part of digital transformation activities and growing a mindset and techniques that allow people and teams to navigate these collaboratively as they occur is only going to drive increased chance of success of the programme. 

### **Continual Improvement and learning** 

This behaviour is fundamental to progressing at pace in an increasingly digital organisation to enable transformation. As part of the embrace uncertainty behaviour, it’s clear not all activity undertaken in a digital transformation will have knowable and predictable outcomes. This behaviour has direct linkage to that in terms of ensuring that staff and teams use every opportunity to learn as they progress and reflect that learning into the next transformation activity. For staff to demonstrate this behaviour it will mean consciously acting to continually learn and improving the knowledge and the level of information that they have. The use of frequent feedback being asked for and acted upon is also key to demonstrating this behaviour appropriately.
