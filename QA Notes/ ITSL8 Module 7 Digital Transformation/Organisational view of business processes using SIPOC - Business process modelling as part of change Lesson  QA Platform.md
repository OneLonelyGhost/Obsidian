Now that we have considered the circumstances in which the business operates, we can turn our attention to what the business does when reacting to the external environment. Bearing in mind that the organisation view is a high-level model of the processes that operate across the entire business. The organisational view shows the end-to-end set of processes that convert the inputs from the suppliers to the outputs of value for the customers.

The organisational view of business processes is an enterprise level model showing sets of *related* processes, and their interactions, in a single diagram. It is useful to distinguish between enterprise level models and business process models. Business process models show a more detailed view of each of the processes at the enterprise level. 

Different models and frameworks can be used to create an enterprise level process model. Supplier, Input, Processes, Output, and Customer (SIPOC) provides a framework to explore all the components that make up an organisations value stream.  

The SIPOC model helps analysts to structure their thinking around processes at the organisational level. It’s not just the elements within the organisation that need to be considered, external elements such as Supplier and Customer are important components also. 

![The SIPOC model. S = Suppliers = The internal/external suppliers of resources or inputs. I – Inputs = The raw materials, requests of information provided by the supplier. P = Processes = The processes carried out to deliver the value to the customer – core processes. O = Outputs = The goods or services created by the processes. C = Customers = The internal/external customers who receive goods](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid3-faf27094-d214-4865-9b77-e1ddaed19b49.png)

### **A worked example:** 

Showing an example for an organisation selling products to customers. When modelling with SIPOC, we would use the 5 headings to list out for the organisation what the different elements are. We would consider the core activities that the organisation carries out to justify its existence. 

![The SIPOC model. S = Suppliers = Customers and product suppliers. I – Inputs = Orders products and products to be sold. P = Processes = 3 x boxes in this field: Take order, Package order and then deliver order. O = Outputs = Delivered products. C = Customers = Customer in receipt of the products.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid5-164607b5-f147-40aa-862f-c11ff7fdc75d.png)

**Figure 3**: The SIPOC model showing the ordering process

- Suppliers: The suppliers of resources. There are two suppliers in this case – the suppliers of the products and the customer who “supplies” the order request.
- Inputs: These are the resources, materials, equipment, or data required to produce the output. From the customer perspective, the order is an input to the organisation. The products to be sold are also an input as they are provided by the supplier.
- Processes: High-level activities to be considered here only (as shown in green).
- Outputs: The products to be delivered.
- Customers: The end customer who receives and benefits from the outputs.

### **Enterprise View of Business Process – SIPOC**

### ![The SIPOC business process flow chart: Suppliers linked to ‘Customer orders’ goods below. Arrow labelled inputs points to Processes, which is linked to the customer orders goods process, take order, package order and deliver order.  The final box ‘Customers’ and deliver order are both then linked to ‘Customer receives goods’ part of the process.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid7-d8e3c2e1-6f7d-4d4b-a544-1ff0904fb889.png)

**Figure 4**: Enterprise View of Business Process – SIPOC

From what we have identified using the SIPOC model, we can construct an enterprise process model to show the set of high-level activities involved in creating an output of value to the customer. 

### **Harmon Expanded View of an Organisation** 

Paul Harmon developed the organisation model in 2007. His view of the enterprise is an extension of the SIPOC as it includes other external elements (not just supplier and customer).

Other external elements are: 

- Competition – competitors will include other organisations competing for these resources as well as customers. This is likely to impact your customers and consequently your internal processes.
- External Environment – what’s going on in the wider market and business domain will also have an impact on your business somehow. The generic “external environment” will include all the other external factors as covered by a PESTLE (political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal, and environmental) analysis.

These provide the context in which the business operates. 

Suppliers are those who supply any type of resource needed for the goods/service to be delivered to the customer. This covers not only physical materials but also finance, people, and ideas. 

Customers is a broad term for any beneficiary of the goods. When looking at this holistically from the organisation view, the customers, owners, partners, and resellers could all benefit from the delivery of the product/service. 

- Customer – direct consumers of the goods
- Owners – vary depending on the nature of the business. Business owners are the main financial beneficiary of how well the organisation is performing. In other cases, it could be shareholders who receive financial rewards.
- Partners – Partner companies who work alongside the organisation to play their part in the process – usually for capabilities the organisation does not have.
- Resellers – intermediary organisations who resell products/services to consumers.

Arrow labelled outputs = Customers (Customers, owners, partners, resellers) with an arrow coming back to the Processes labelled requests. Suppliers are also linked down to ‘Competition’ (Competitors, new entrants, new product/service substitutes), which is linked back to Customers.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-ab5c72d6-dbed-49b3-99e9-e0a049f5989e.png)

### **Why Consider the External Context?** 

We need to consider the **external context** of the processes because business processes operate *within* this context. 

If we want to improve the business processes, we need answers to the following questions to help us identify the changes that will deliver success: 

- What resources do they require? Are they in short supply? Who else is after them?
- Who else is chasing our customers? What do they offer?
- Who are the owners whom we need to satisfy?
- Who exactly are our customers? What do they require? How demanding are they?
- What other external factors may have an impact on us?

In the next step you will explore the next level down event level process modelling.
