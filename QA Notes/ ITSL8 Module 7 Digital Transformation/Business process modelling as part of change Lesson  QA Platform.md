## Business process modelling

Whether we are involved in extensive business change or providing new IT services for existing processes, it is vital that we document (where not already done) and understand the business processes before embarking on digital technology requirements capture. 

### **Why do organisations model business processes?** 

![Graphic showing all the reasons why organisations model business processes: Ease of comms, aid understanding, identify where errors occur, regulatory compliance, staff training, opportunities for automation, documentation and how it identifies inefficiencies: duplication, prepetition, redundant elements, bottle necks, delays and actor/task mismatch.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-9405fd4d-cba5-4281-869e-f6bac2bffe93.png)

Figure 1: Reasons why organisations model business processes.

### **Why Model Business Processes?** 

Among the reasons organisations document business processes are to: 

- Document an undocumented process.
- Look for efficiency gains.
- Look for automation opportunities.
- Enforce a consistent / standard way of doing a process.
- Train staff now and in the future.
- Satisfy a regulator.
- Look for problems.
- Enable change for a new product or service.
- Save money.
- Improve customer service.
- Cope with mergers and acquisitions.

**Process Modelling is part of Business Architecture.** It provides documentation, so we know what we *should* be doing, makes future change more agile and secure and is often necessary for certification (ISO etc). Business architecture is not a project-based activity. 

**Process Modelling is part of problem-solving,** which aids communication and understanding between the stakeholders and helps identify and solve problems. Problem-solving *is* a project-based activity. 

**Role of IT in Businesses** 

Information is one of the keys strategic resources of the business, along with people, finance, and time.

IT can make processes more efficient and more effective, by improving: 

- Accuracy
- Speed
- Consistancy

### **Approaches to Business Process Modelling**  

Unfortunately, there is little agreement on terms here. The important thing is that each organisation decides on standards and sticks to them across all projects. We’ve selected commonly used terminology and will stick with that throughout the course, using a Workflow approach.

Other possible approaches include: 

- Data Flow oriented
- Object oriented
- Holistic Systems

### **Hierarchy of Business Processes**  

Granularity is a major problem in process modelling – after all, at a very coarse level of granularity, the whole organisation is just one big process! One approach is to model at different conceptual levels. To make it even easier to understand and apply the different techniques we will use the following to denote each level. 

- **Level 0**: **Context level:** Shows the enterprise as a single entity and is used to set the context for the lower levels. Here, the enterprise is visualised as a “black box” with no details shown on the processes that make-up the organisation.
- **Level 1**: **Enterprise level**: Shows the processes in relation to each other and their environment; however, we don’t see the detail of how each process works internally. Processes shown at this level are primarily focussed on what we call the **value stream**: Processes that are directly involved in the creation of core products and services delivered to a customer. A process model at this level captures the summary of the core processes that make up the organisation.
- **Level 2: Event-Response Level Process:** A **process** at this level shows the internal logic of the flow of each process, through a series of tasks. When people talk of **process modelling** this is the level most people are thinking of.
- **Level 3:** **Actor-Task level: T**akes each step in the relevant process model and expands the detail of it, for example as a procedure document. There might be a case for including lower-level diagrams here too.

### **Process Levels**

![Process Levels diagram. At the top of the image is The Enterprise (the main business). 1 = Enterprise Level: Value Stream. 2 = Event-response Level: Process flow. 3 = Actor-task Level: Procedural.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-609a9377-d9d8-4356-b1b0-487cf23d40d2.png)

Figure 2: Process Levels flow chart

### **Level** = 0

**Tool/Technique** = Context level – for information and a starting point only 

**Description** = It helps to determine the context and the highest-level business process that the organisation needs to perform ‘Business as Usual’.

**Level** = 1

**Tool/Technique** = Organisational model of the value stream 

Description = This level helps determines the processes needed to deliver value to the main beneficiary. It shows the dependencies between processes. 

### **Level** = 2

**Tool/Technique** = Process flow (swimlane) 

**Description** = The level most of us are comfortable at – this level provides the detailed flow, the **tasks**, who participates (the actors) and the key decisions or business rules that constrain the process. 

### **Level** = 3

### **Tool/Technique** = Tasks

**Description** = Although tasks fit within the process model, they can usually be further decomposed to reflect the **steps** taken by the actor to complete the task.

Levels 0 and 1 together are referred to as the “Organisational model of processes”, bringing together the external context and internal business processes to provide a high-level view.  All businesses have processes – but many businesses do not identify them or manage them. To examine the processes, we will first explore how organisations are structured.

You will now explore organisational level views which will enable you to see different aspects of the enterprise.
