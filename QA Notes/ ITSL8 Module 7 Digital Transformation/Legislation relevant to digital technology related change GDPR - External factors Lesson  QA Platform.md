GDPR applies to all organizations that are controllers or processors of personal data and have an establishment within the EU. In order to ensure the rights of EU citizens are protected the scope of the law extends to controllers or processors who reside outside the EU but process EU citizen personal data, also known as a data subject. The requirement is to protect EU citizen's fundamental rights to have personal data protected.

The legislation sets out clear definitions of terms to ensure consistency and application across the EU and provides legal certainty and accountability. A data subject’s rights are enhanced such as the right to object to personal data being processed and allows for data subject to withdraw their consent for an organization to process their data at any time.

The right to be forgotten that is the right to personal data being erased is now a requirement and obligates controllers of data to stipulate a data retention policy or review policy and provide that information to the data subject. The law provides for a right to restrict data processing and provides for a right to data portability. GDPR sets out more clearly, the obligations for data controllers and processes and where accountability and liabilities lie.

The legislation was aimed to try and future proof the regulation. It sets out the principles of personal data protection in that it should be technologically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used which ensures the principles apply, however an organization intends to process personal data.

GDPR now clearly applies to online data which is collected by websites including IP addresses. Organizations must review how their sites work in line with the principles and requirements of GDPR in order to ensure compliance with online privacy requirements and the regulations.

This diagram gives a high-level overview of how GDPR works in practice. GDPR defines articles which are mandatory requirements and laws and recitals which are commentaries and guidelines showing how such articles are likely to be interpreted.

The EDPB are the European Data Protection Board. They are currently known as Working Party 29, WP29. They manage all supervisory authorities and are creating guides on various key requirements.

The ICO is the Information Commissioner's Office. They are the UK’s Supervisory Authority, SA, for data protection and GDPR from May 2018.

A DPO is a Data Protection Officer and is the person within an organization who is responsible for overseeing data protection strategy and implementation to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

The person about whom data has been stored is the data subject and GDPR affords them subject rights in respect of their data.

They are able to raise complaints with the ICO if they feel their subject rights have been breached.

The principles of GDPR are based on current, existing data protection principles. Controllers must show their processing is lawful, fair and transparent with regard to the data subject’s rights. Purpose limitation has been tightened, in its definition in the law where personal data shall be collected, for specified explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.

Generic or blanket purpose statements will not be considered compatible with GDPR. The requirements to only collect what is necessary remains unchanged and the emphasis on correcting data means that controllers must ensure personal data is corrected, without undue delay.

Data Retention is also a key requirement to ensure that data is not kept longer than needed. However, there is a provision that data may be kept in archive for statistical purposes but controllers must be able to demonstrate to the ICO that there is a need to keep the data and that the data is not being used to support a just-in-case we need it approach. There should be some clear requirement, for the statistical purposes of the data and once the statistics have been produced, the need to keep the original data should be reviewed.

Controllers should also be aware that keeping this data will mean it is subject to Subject Access Requests or SARs. GDPR states that personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage using appropriate technical or organizational measures.

GDPR puts more emphasis on organizations to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures.
