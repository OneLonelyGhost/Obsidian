Achieving success from a digital transformation will often require a whole programme of initiatives to be built and delivered. This could involve automating existing business elements, or changing business and operating models to be partially or fully digital. 

The use of a transformation task force to define and implement the digital transformation programme is a good tactic. A task force should consist of senior leaders and experts in technology, customer experience, and the organisation’s business activities. 

During the digital transformation programme, the task force should ensure a deliberate and constant focus on organisational change management is maintained. This will ensure that people and teams across the whole organisation are prepared for the rollout of the new digital capabilities as they are introduced throughout the programme. 

Digital transformation will never be effectively achieved if it involves relying on a single leader, so it is important to establish correct oversight.

The organisation must ensure the following: 

- **Governance:** The organisation must ensure that digital transformation happens within the strategy and policies set by the governing body, and is managed consistently across all impacted units of the organisation. This can be established through a steering committee.

- **Leadership:** A transformation task force consisting of key leaders and experts will be needed to lead the digital transformation, since this will impact all parts of the organisation.

- **Collaboration:** This is central to achieving success. Using the collaboration model will help define how communication will work across the various teams and functions involved in the transformation programme.

### **Define a vision** 

Every organisation needs to have a clear overall strategy, purpose, and vision. There also needs to be a clear definition of what becoming a “digital organisation” means. The leadership and transformation task force need to clearly communicate this vision across the organisation. When the strategy has been defined, the task force can use it to define a more detailed vision for the digital transformation programme, and to set specific goals for the programme. 

### **Assess capabilities** 

A key early aspect of running a successful digital transformation programme is to assess the current digital capabilities of the organisation.

This assessment will enable a clearer understanding of how the organisation intends to use its digital capabilities. There may be existing capabilities that can remain in use. The assessment also allows the identification of digital capabilities that need to be developed or are entirely missing. For example, the assessment may identify a lack of customer journey maps for the core customer-facing activities or supporting technologies, despite the fact that these are required for any customer experience-related digital initiative. The outputs of this assessment can then feed into the detailed design changes of the transformation programme.

### **Define objectives** 

The digital transformation programme will build the capabilities the organisation needs to achieve its strategic objectives. A set of programme\-based objectives will need to be defined and agreed with reference to the following:  

- The digital transformation programme must be in accordance with any existing policies and constraints defined in the organisation’s strategy and its business and operating models.

- Using the digital assessment as a baseline to reference from.

### **Design the changes** 

The transformation task force and existing IT resources will inform design changes for all areas that need to be changed. These changes will often be wide ranging, examples include documents, business processes, activities, infrastructure, applications, data sources, organisational structures, roles, and skills.  

### **Define a transformation roadmap** 

The transformation task force will group the changes into initiatives and sequence them. Groupings could be made based on several factors e.g., by business process, geography, product area, etc. 

The grouping of these changes does not necessarily have to be the same for each digital initiative. For example, the first initiative of the programme may focus on transforming each business function and its individual business processes. The next initiative and change might be grouping them and then may look at organisation-wide digital aspects rather than per function aspects. 

As each digital initiative is delivered it is important for the teams involved to review and, where necessary, adjust future plans based on their findings. The transformation roadmap needs to show deliverables at a per initiative level, not just overall deliverables once the whole programme is complete.

### **Implement** 

The digital task force will ensure appropriate approval of each individual digital initiative via its governance activity. The task force also ensures ownership is allocated for each initiative. Plans and budgets also need to be defined for each initiative: it’s the job of the digital task force to ensure that resources and funding are made available as needed. Each digital project initiative will then define individual work packages, with iterations, so that feedback can be provided, data collected, and the project or programme adjusted as lessons are learned. 

### **Measure and improve** 

As each project initiative of the digital transformation programme is delivered, progress and quality need to be measured. You must be aware that, as each initiative is delivered, it might lead to other changes to the higher-level enterprise strategy.

The importance of measurement is therefore not just to focus on the progress made against the digital transformation programme, but also to measure the effectiveness of the programme outputs in how they are supporting the digital strategy.
