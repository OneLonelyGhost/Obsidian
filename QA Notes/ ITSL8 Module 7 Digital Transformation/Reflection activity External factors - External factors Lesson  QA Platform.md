Reflecting on the best practices you have learnt so far about the importance of evaluating the external factors as part of a structured approach to digital transformation. Document at least three examples of where external factors were incorporated into work to deliver a new digital initiative successfully in your organisation (include at least one legal example in those 3). 

For each example, document: 

- What type of an external factor was it (using PESTLE categories)?
- What specific activities of the programme were incorporated to ensure compliance/accordance with the external factor?
- How did the programme measure success against each external factor?

Once you have completed this task keep your report safe. At the end of this Learning Path you will need to collate all the reports you have created into one document and then upload them into Bud.

You have now come to the end of this Lesson in the next Lesson you will explore behaviours, risks and ethics in relation to implementing a digital transformation.
