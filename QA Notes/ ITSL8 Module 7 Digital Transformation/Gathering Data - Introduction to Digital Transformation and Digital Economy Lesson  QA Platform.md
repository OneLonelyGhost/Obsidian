A key driver behind digital transformation is the need to improve, modernize and streamline the experience consumers have with your business. But to do this, you’ll need to  have a deep understanding of consumer behavior, and this relies on access to good-quality data. 

To gather this data, you’ll need to pay close attention to how your consumers are behaving during the various interactions they have with your brand. But, why stop there? You'll also find valuable information about consumer behavior and expectations by looking at the other companies these shoppers value, and seeing what they have to offer that you might not.  

Shoppers today have certain expectations about their online shopping experience. Most people expect prices to be listed in their local currency, and for delivery times to be as quick as possible. Memberships like Amazon Prime have arguably set the expectation for next-day delivery across most of the eCommerce landscape. 

And, because a lot of shoppers use mobile devices to browse products, do research and make purchases on-the-go, businesses are expected to make the digital customer experience as streamlined as possible, and optimized for any device. 

When brands fail to meet these expectations, they’re often met with frustrated shoppers who are more likely to abandon their carts, or switch to another brand entirely that’s already optimized its shopping experience.

Your business will most likely be gathering a range of consumer data, from a variety of sources. Luckily, there are some helpful tools that can help you do precisely this.

First up - a Customer Relationship Management system, or ‘CRM’, which stores data about your consumers in a centralized database. Information like names, phone numbers, email addresses and even social media profiles can be managed, updated and accessed by all relevant teams. Every interaction between consumers and your brand is tracked here, as well as their purchase history. A CRM also stores helpful targeting information, like hobbies, interests, attitudes and preferences.

Next, Customer Data Platforms or CDPs, take things even further. These gather data from multiple sources, including CRM systems, social media channels, your advertising, your analytics data, and even transactional data collected offline. CDPs then use machine learning to perform a highly complex analysis of this information. This can give you insights that will help you improve your marketing campaigns and product development, and even enhance consumer retention. 

Finally, web and eCommerce analytics track and report on consumer buying behaviors, and can help you identify any pain points that might be getting in the way of providing a great customer experience.

Using one - or a combination - of these tools will help you gather data and extract the insights needed to get a more detailed picture of your consumers. This should then inform your digital transformation efforts and decision-making. This way, you can ensure the initiatives you put in place are serving consumer needs from the get-go, without wasting much-needed time and resources on ‘gut-feelings’ or assumptions.
