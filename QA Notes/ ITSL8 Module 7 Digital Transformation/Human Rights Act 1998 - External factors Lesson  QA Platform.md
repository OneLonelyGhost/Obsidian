### **Human Rights Act 1998** 

Coming into force in October 2000, the UK’s Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) incorporated the fundamental rights and freedoms established in the European Commission on Human Rights (ECHR) into British law, affecting everyone who lives in the UK. This aligned British Law with ECHR, as mandated in Article 1 of ECHR, requiring public bodies to respect and protect the rights set out in law and also allowed for any breaches to be handled by a domestic British court. 

###  **UK HRA Article 8: Right to Privacy** 

1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Personal Data Protection is covered under **Article 8**, ‘Respect for your private and family life, home and correspondence therefore lapses, by public bodies, of data security could contravene HRA. 

The collection, release and storage of Personal Data are all potential breaches of **Article 8** in and of themselves. 

Whether they amount to as much, would depend on an assessment of whether or not those activities were proportionate, and carried out ‘in accordance with the law‘ or necessary for legitimate democratic functioning (i.e., national security, public health and safety, etc.). 

A recent example of such an assessment has been South Wales Police’s use of automated facial recognition (AFR) technology, and whether it had impinged on people’s civil liberties. 

**Data Protection and Human Rights Precedent** 

“The protection of personal data, particularly medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general. The domestic law must afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any such communication or disclosure of personal health data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees in Article 8 of the Convention.” 

(*MS v Sweden (1997) 28 EHRR 313, para. 41*). 

The High Court has dismissed an application for judicial review regarding the use of Automated Facial Recognition Technology (AFR) and its implications for privacy rights and data protection.
