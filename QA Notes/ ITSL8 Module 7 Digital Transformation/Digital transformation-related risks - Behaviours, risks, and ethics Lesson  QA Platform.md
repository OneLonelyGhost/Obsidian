Risk management as part of digital transformation will vary in organisations depending on whether looking at risk programmatically across the whole business change or more granularly on a per initiative basis as part of business case construction.  

At whatever level of risks being considered, risks around digital transformation will occur from various sources, examples include: 

- Vulnerabilities occurring as a consequence of new digital technology which are then exploited by cyber-criminals, damaging the organisation both financially, reputationally etc.

- Unintended results and unexpected ethical issues occurring as a consequence of the digital technology being consumed in ways that weren’t originally intended or predicted.

- Untried and immature new technology giving rise to increased unexpected costs and not the delivering the expected performance.

- Alternative technologies rapidly emerging that could “leap-frog” the digital technologies chosen and erode too quickly the benefits expected of the existing technologies chosen.

- Cultural rejection – new digital enabled ways of working might not ultimately fit and work in the current culture of the employees and customers.

- Internet of Things (IoT) aspects of digital transformation – These will open up information, and the operating attributes of equipment to potentially increased risk since ever more aspects of the organisation are constantly connected.

As part of best practice, in an increasingly digital organisation risk management will need all stakeholders in the organisation to be educated and aware of the general approach to risk management activities. In addition, stakeholders across the organisation will need to contribute to risk assessment and mitigation using the tools provided to them. 

Best practice in delivering digital transformation in organisations at the lowest risk levels is to make small, well evaluated steps around proposed initiatives therefore keeping the risks level low. Use of rapid prototyping and minimum viable products with feedback and capturing of data will ensure that when large investment decisions are required to commit to full application of a digital technology then the right understandings have already been obtained from the MVP and prototyping activities.  

In the next step you will explore what ethical considerations you should take when implementing a business transformation.
