## What Is Digital Transformation and Digital Economy?

The digital economy is a blending together of the term digital computing and economy and is a broad term that describes how classically manual economic activities (e.g. manufacturing, construction, financial service industries etc.) are being transformed by the application of digital technologies across any sector and any organisation. 

Digital technologies increasingly transform how any organisation operates and as a consequence this stimulates the need to develop new, more agile business models to remain competitive in any market of consumers. New, emerging digital technology, such as generative AI, enables organisations to work at increasing pace and effectiveness to serve better their customers and help to realise the organisation’s vision. 

### **Digital organisation and digital transformation**  

A digital organisation is an organisation that is enabled by digital technology to do business significantly differently. 

Digital technology has been used for decades in most organisations. What differentiates a digital organisation is the extent to which it uses digital technology as a fundamental way to differentiate itself. Therefore, truly digital organisations use and rely on digital technology as a cornerstone of their business and operating models. 

For most organisations the target is not to be an entirely digital organisation but to utilise an appropriate mix of digital, analogue, and manual activities. To be successful in the digital economy an organisation needs to decide which parts of the business to digitise and to what extent, so that it can achieve and maintain a competitive advantage. 

Digital transformation is the process of adopting digital technology across the business to make a significant improvement in realising the business objectives. This will involve changing the way the business operates and how it delivers its products and services to its consumers.
