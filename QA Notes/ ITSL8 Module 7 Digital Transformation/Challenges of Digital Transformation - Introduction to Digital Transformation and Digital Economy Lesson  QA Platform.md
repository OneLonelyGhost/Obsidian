While digital transformation can offer incredible benefits to a business, these successes aren’t without their challenges. After all, large-scale change is rarely simple, and it takes many teams from across the business to create a strategy, design the solutions, and ultimately implement the change.

One of the biggest challenges for businesses is that most of them have a number of separate and distinct teams, without regular cross-team communication. This creates silos and gets in the way of seamless interactions between the business, its workforce, and even consumers. Digital transformation strives to improve the customer experience by streamlining how products and services are delivered, and this often involves breaking down these silos, to enable more efficient and effective communication between teams. 

A great example of this in action is PwC’s ‘citizen-led digital innovation’ project. The business began its ongoing digital transformation back in 2016, focussing on a people-first approach that would save time and money, while improving customer experience. 

The aim was to remove barriers between its ‘back office’ and front end teams, which involved three main areas of focus: business strategy, human-centered design, and the right technologies to help them achieve their objective. 

PwC sent out a survey to its 3,500 partners, asking them to highlight what their pain points were, and what they thought might be slowing down their work. The business quickly identified 25 processes that needed to change across several teams, which included removing repetitive tasks that took up most of the teams’ time and would save the company around $100 million in costs.

This shows how great communication can have a huge impact on the quality of work that your teams are able to deliver, and ultimately on the overall performance of the business. Effective change management encourages teams to get involved in the process of digital transformation, wherever possible. And, you’ll probably find this leads to your teams feeling valued, your consumers feeling heard, and crucially, provides you with more opportunities to increase revenue. 

It’s important to note that PwC’s changes were made incrementally and over a number of years. Your digital transformation will likely have a similar timespan. This will help to keep disruption to a minimum and allow the day-to-day business to continue. In most cases, the work related to digital transformation is carried out by existing teams alongside their current workload, which isn’t always sustainable. Because of this, many businesses decide to get support from external consultants or specialists. You might find this will also help you and your teams, so it’s certainly worth considering as an option. 

You should also try to avoid any quick fixes or shortcuts that will create more problems later down the line. A ‘build now, fix later’ mindset might bring you closer to your digital transformation goals in the short-term, but in the long-term, it might set you back. 

A common example of this is known as ‘technical debt’, which is the fragmentation of technology platforms, and it happens when too many tech changes are introduced at once. Some businesses use technical debt to their advantage, but if it happens unintentionally, you might find that your business is spending more time putting out fires than it is moving forward with its transformation. 

This is why your digital transformation strategy will need continuous improvement over time, with everyone’s ongoing input to keep things on track. 

So, to find success in this area, and keep your business competitive, it’s important to strike a balance between short and long-term needs, and to communicate with both your teams and consumers. This will go a long way in making the digital transformation process a much smoother transition.
