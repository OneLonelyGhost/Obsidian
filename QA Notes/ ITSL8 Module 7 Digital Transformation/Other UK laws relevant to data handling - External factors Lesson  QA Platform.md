### **Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (1988)** 

The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act (CDPA) came into force in November 1988 protecting creators’ ‘works’ from being used or distributed without their consent.  

Among the categories protected are literary, dramatic and musical works, and sound recordings and films. The period of protection typically extends for 70 years from the creator’s death, or 70 years from the creation of the work (for computer based works this is reduced to 50 years.) 

### **Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs)**

These are legal rights and protect inventions and creations that have originated from intellectual activity. Intellectual Property usually applies in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic sectors. The most common methods of IP protection are copyrights, patents, marks and trade secrets.

Anything that you code yourself, be that a data analysis model, neural net etc., could be subject to copyright as a literary work. Since 1998 this protection has extended in some part to databases.

### **Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations (1997)** 

The CDPA was amended in 1998 with the inclusion of Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations. 

### **Database, ad defined in law**

‘Database‘ means a collection of independent works, data or other materials which are: 

1. arranged in a systematic or methodical way, and
2. individually accessible by electronic or other means.

A literary work consisting of a database is original if, and only if, by reason of the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database the database constitutes the author’s own intellectual creation. 

The Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 ([legislation.gov.uk](https://app.qa.com/admin/clouda/courses/qalecture/26011/change/legislation.gov.uk)) 

It meant that individual items added to databases could now be considered ‘works’ and enjoy Copyright Protection by virtue of being part of a database. 

This imbued Database Rights on systematically organised collections of data, giving the Data Owner Intellectual Property Rights over the database for 15 years. If the Data Owner can show sufficient investment into the database at the end of the period of protection, they can renew it for a further 15 years. 

Furthermore, if evidence of significant originality or substantial investment in collecting and processing the contents, a database may be granted full copyright protection as may be granted to a work of art such as a novel. This greatly restricts what others can do with the database. 

Of course, exceptions exist in all copyright law, such as non-commercial data mining, accessibility, education and fair dealing. 

### **Exceptions to Copyright**

As well as owning copyright works yourself, you may wish to make use of someone else’s copyright protected works. There are certain very specific situations where you may be permitted to do so without seeking permission from the owner. Exceptions to copyright - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)
