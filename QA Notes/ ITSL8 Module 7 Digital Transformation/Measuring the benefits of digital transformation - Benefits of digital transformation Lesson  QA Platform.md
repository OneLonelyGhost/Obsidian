There are several principles which will guide successful measuring of the performance of a digital transformation programme and strategy: 

- Ensure that budgetary cycles and policy are in step with the digital strategy cycle, not the other way around.

- Actively change the existing strategy as external factors emerge and change. Do not start from scratch unless the entire strategy has failed.

- Align operational reporting of the digital transformation programme with strategic reports so that the impact of a digital strategy is easier to measure.

- Ensure the frequency of the digital strategy being reviewed matches the frequency with which the business environment is changing. Reviewing annually is adequate for stable environments, but less stable environments should review the strategy at least quarterly, and the progress of strategic initiatives at least monthly.

A digital strategy should be measured and evaluated to ensure that progress is being made, the results are checked, and the direction is validated. This ensures the three main reasons to measure strategy are to: 

- Judge whether it is achieving its defined objectives (the performance)
- Determine whether the strategy is being implemented as planned (the progress)
- indicate whether it is still relevant/suitable given changes in the internal or external environment (the relevance).

### **Measuring performance** 

Completing initiatives does not automatically result in achieving all the objectives of the digital strategy. There are many other factors at play. For example, the strategy might have overlooked a critical element, or underestimated the importance of some aspect of the organisation or its environment.  

Leaders responsible for defining and implementing the strategy will need to know how the organisation is progressing against its stated objectives. Some of these will be performance-based (e.g. whether revenue is increasing). Others will be related to achieving a certain defined objective (e.g. achieving a certain level of industry certification).  

Actions made in response to these performance reports might include: 

- Changing the digital strategy to respond to a particular event (e.g. speeding entry of a new product into an existing market because a new competitor has emerged as a disruptor.)

- Moving to implementing an alternative scenario (e.g. the strategy was based on a high market willingness to conduct business online, but experience has shown only a moderate acceptance; this was an alternative scenario in the strategy).

- Withdrawing from an opportunity or market, thus cancelling that part of the strategy.

- Executives and members of the governing body who are not directly involved in managing the strategy will need to be informed of changes to it. This will enable them to get involved in decisions as required.

### **Measuring progress** 

Stakeholders will need to ensure that the digital initiatives used to implement the strategy are proceeding as expected. They will need reports that show the status of each initiative and inform them of any potential or actual exceptions to what has been planned. 

Leaders of the digital transformation will need to know the status of every action, who is performing it, and whether it is on time, within budget, and to specification. Actions or decisions will often occur as a consequence. Potential actions could be: 

- The need to reschedule.
- Alerting the need for a changed level of resources.
- Enabling leaders to be aware of potential delays or cost overruns.
- Deciding whether to continue with the initiative or switch to an alternative.

### **Measuring relevance** 

As any organisation implements its digital strategy and the objectives are being achieved according to plan, changes in the internal and external environments might change that at any time. Leaders responsible for the digital strategy of the organisation should constantly continue to monitor the factors of the environment that led them to define their current strategy in the first place. 

Once a digital strategy and transformation programme starts being implemented organisational change is triggered. Strategy reviews should consider that the digital strategy itself could be causing further unintended changes, not just reacting to changes in external environment. This means that digital strategy metrics must focus on changes to the environment that happen independently of the strategy, as well as cause-and-effect relationships embedded within the strategy itself.
