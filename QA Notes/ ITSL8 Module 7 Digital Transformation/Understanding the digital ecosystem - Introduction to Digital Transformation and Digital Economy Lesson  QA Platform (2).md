When you’re setting out to achieve digital transformation, you’ll need to look at your entire digital ecosystem, and identify any areas of the business that need to be modernized or streamlined. Take the customer experience for example. You’ll want to make sure that each interaction a shopper has with your business is providing real value, and helping them to easily discover and purchase your products. 

Your business will also need to make sure it’s taking an omnichannel approach, so that you can provide consumers with a consistent experience across all platforms, channels and devices.

This is the approach that retailer IKEA took, when the brand saw an opportunity to undergo its own digital transformation. For a long time, IKEA relied on its physical stores to generate most of its profits, with eCommerce accounting for around 10% of total retail sales in 2019. So, IKEA used the insights it had around consumer behavior and expectations to greatly improve the customer experience and, in turn, grow its eCommerce revenue.

The brand decided to tie its online and in-store experiences together, allowing consumers to place an order online, and then collect their items in store. In some countries, shoppers can even use IKEA’s app to scan and pay for their items, which can then be collected from a more convenient location. 

IKEA’s digital transformation efforts eventually grew its eCommerce retail sales share to an impressive 22% by the end of 2022, proving it to be a truly worthwhile investment.

This is a great example of how a business can take an omnichannel approach to its digital transformation. By evaluating its digital ecosystem, IKEA was able to adapt its processes to suit changing consumer needs and behavior. 

It’s worth mentioning that, because digital transformation reaches across all areas of a business, the process might feel a bit more complicated for companies that have multiple supply chains, or that operate in a range of countries, all with their individual priorities. 

If this is the case for your business, try to prioritize the areas that will have the biggest impact across the business as a whole, before you start to address those more focused, individual needs. This is where metrics and KPIs will be particularly useful. You can use them to measure performance across different areas of the business, and establish those that need more immediate attention, and those that offer the biggest return on investment.

Once you’ve prioritized the areas you want to focus on, you can start setting transformation milestones, with the highest impact areas first on your list. Your milestones should have realistic time frames, but should also allow you to start measuring the impact of changes as soon as possible. This will hopefully help you deliver maximum business value, in the shortest amount of time.
