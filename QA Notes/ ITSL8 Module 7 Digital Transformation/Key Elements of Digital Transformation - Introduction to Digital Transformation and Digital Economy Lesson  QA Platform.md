There are a number of key elements you'll need to focus on as part of your digital transformation, and the first on your list will be both your people and processes. They can often go overlooked, or be sidelined in favor of other factors like new technology, but they're going to be an essential part of your success.

The people within your business will be integral to sustaining and improving its performance over time, and your strategy will likely rely on teams adopting new ways of working. If they’re not given the support to integrate these new approaches into their day-to-day operations, then your entire strategy is at risk of falling through. 

As well as people and processes, your strategy will most likely also revolve around the customer experience. After all, the experience that consumers have with your business will play a big part in determining its long-term performance and success, making this a crucial element of digital transformation. 

In today's competitive digital landscape, businesses are striving to give consumers a positive and memorable online experience. It’s no secret that consumers now expect truly personalized and seamless interactions with almost any business they come into contact with online. So, chances are, at least part of the motivation behind your digital transformation is the need to modernize and enhance these experiences for shoppers. 

Once upon a time, brands only needed to worry about direct competitors. But, as technology continues to evolve, the experience shoppers have with one company can set their expectations for other brands, even if they're operating in different markets. These businesses are setting the standard when it comes to things like the customization of products and services, wait times for deliveries, and how seamless a customer service experience is. And, consumers today have a wealth of choice right at their fingertips, making it even easier for them to switch to a different brand when those expectations aren’t met.

And of course, as well as people, processes and the customer experience, you’ll also need to consider the technology and capabilities your business needs. When it comes to choosing new technology, you might hear people say something like, "If we just had this platform or that capability, then things would be much better". And, while digital tools can have a truly transformative impact on your business, you shouldn't rely on technology alone. It can certainly be a big part of your conversations, but it shouldn’t necessarily be the driving force behind all decision making.

When businesses allow technology to take the lead, they often run into challenges later down the line, or find themselves limited by the capabilities of the tools they’ve chosen. A more effective and sustainable approach takes all the other elements of digital transformation into account first. Your strategy, people, processes and consumers should inform your decision making when it comes to choosing the right tech - not the other way around.
