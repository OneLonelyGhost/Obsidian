Business process modelling is an important part of any digital transformation process. Think about the organisation you work for and consider what modelling processes they have in place.

Write a report detailing:

- What processes are used as part of a digital transformation project?
- Identify any gaps there might be and, if there are any gaps, what would you recommend they include to help fill those gaps.

Thinking back to the content you have just worked through consider the following and add your thoughts to your report:

- What are the benefits of using a process model as part of a digital transformation change?
- Does the organisation you work for use the SIPOC framework, if so, how was it applied and detail how it supported the project it was used for? If it hasnâ€™t been used, think about how it could be used within the organisation you work for?

Once you have completed this task, keep your report safe. At the end of this Learning Path, you will need to collate all the reports you have created into one document and then upload them into Bud.

You have come to the end of this Lesson. In the next step you will test your learning and understanding by completing a Knowledge Check. Once completed, you will move on to the next Lesson, External Factors.
