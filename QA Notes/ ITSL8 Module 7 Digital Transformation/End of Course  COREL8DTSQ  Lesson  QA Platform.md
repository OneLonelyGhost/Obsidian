## Submit your reflection 

Your last task in this stage is to complete a reflection statement to summarise what you have taken away. You will submit your reflection statement on Bud.

When writing your reflection, consider the following:

- What are the key things you have learnt?
- When you return to your workplace what will you start and stop doing, and why?
- How will you know that you have been successful?

Now please answer the following knowledge questions which relate to your SQA unit for this module. Write at least one relevant paragraph per question.

You should include screenshots from your Discover learning resources, to help you contextualise your answers to the questions below. This should help you to contribute the expected standards of evidence overall for your qualification.

1. Describe in an overview what is meant by the business terms ‘Digital Economy’ and ‘Digital Transformation’. Consider the organisational principles it would assist and improve.
2. Define some standard organisational processes and how digital transformation could improve them.
3. Describe an organisational mission / objective, and how Digital Transformation could improve it.
4. Describe which processes could be considered for, and what an organisation needs to consider, when investing in Digital Transformation. Include what a business case might cover.
5. What would be the benefits, improvements, and efficiencies of carrying out Business Digital Transformation? Consider the legislation, regulations and internal policies when carrying out the transformation.
6. Give examples of what would be considered professional and unprofessional behaviour or practices when carrying out Digital Transformation.
7. What metrics, applications, and tools could be implemented to monitor and measure Digital Transformation activities.
8. What ethical and social issues should be considered / addressed during Digital Transformation. Consider climate, GDPR, information management, and others.
