There will be a broad set of stakeholders both internal and external impacted and involved when an organisation goes through a digital transformation programme. How you communicate with these stakeholders will be a key aspect of bringing common understanding and driving success from the programme.  

Identify in your organisation from a recent completed digital initiative three different examples of external stakeholders that were involved in the initiative i.e. they were impacted as a consequence of the new digital technology being rolled out but not directly involved in the activity to implement it. For each stakeholder, document the following: 

- How early were they initially communicated with and through what methods did that communication occur?
- Through what mechanisms could they feedback to the digital initiative leaders to ensure the digital technology rollout would be relevant to their needs?

Once you have completed this task keep your report safe. At the end of this Learning Path you will need to collate all the reports you have created into one document and then upload them into Bud.

In the next step you will watch a video, Challenge of digital transformation and then test your learning and understanding by completing a Knowledge Check. Once completed, you will then move on to the next Lesson, Implementation of Digital Change in businesses.
