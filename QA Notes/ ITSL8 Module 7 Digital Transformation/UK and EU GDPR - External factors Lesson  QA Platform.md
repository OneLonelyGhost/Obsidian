The UK’s DPA 2018 has already enacted the EU GDPR’s requirements into UK law, and with effect from 1 January 2021.  The DPPEC (Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit)) Regulations 2019 amended the DPA 2018 and merged it with the requirements of the EU GDPR to form a new, UK specific data protection regime that operates in a UK context post-Brexit as part of the DPA 2018. 

This new regime is known as ‘the UK GDPR’. 

The UK GDPR came into effect on 01 January 2021 following Brexit. It sets out the key principles, rights and obligations for the large majority of personal data that is processed in the UK, except for law enforcement and intelligence agencies. It provides more control, by issuing requirements for businesses, governments, and other organisations in regard to data disclosure, giving more transparency in their data practices, and regulating the way they collect, process, and store people’s data. 

### **GDPR Fact**

The GDPR is designed to be dynamic and responsive in this digital age. GDPR covers a wider extension to DPA especially in relation to the data rights of individuals. It is obligatory for all organisations to create transparent policies and procedures aimed at the protection of personal data.

The UK GDPR is based on the EU GDPR which applied in the UK before 01 January 2021, with some adjustments to make it work more effectively with the UK.

The list below highlights the important differences between the Data Protection Act 2018/UK GDPR and the EU GDPR. 

The UK GDPR is quite similar to the EU GDPR. Data subjects still have the same rights. There are still the same data processing principles and lawful bases for lawful processing. Data controllers and processors are also still obliged to guarantee the security of the personal data they process. 

**Criteria:** Defining Personal data 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** The definition is more limited. 

**EU GDPR**: Personal data can include Internet cookies, IP addresses and DNA. 

**Criteria:** Data Subject Rights 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** Data subject rights can be waived if they significantly inhibit an organisation’s legitimate need to process data for scientific, historical, statistical and archiving purposes. 

**EU GDPR**: Protects data subjects to personal data processing. 

**Criteria:** Privacy versus Freedom of Expression 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** An exemption exists in relation to the processing of personal data if it is in the public interest. 

**EU GDPR**: No exemption.

**Criteria:** Representatives 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** Many non-EU data controllers and processors that offer goods and services to, or monitor the behaviour of, data subjects in the UK must appoint a representative in the UK. 

**EU GDPR**: Appoint an EU representative. 

**Criteria:** Automated Decision-Making Process 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** Permits automated.  

profiling if there are legitimate grounds for the task. 

**EU GDPR**: Data subjects have the right to refuse automated decision making or profiling. 

**Criteria:** **Child Consent Age** 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** Give consent for data processing at 13. 

**EU GDPR**: Give consent at 16. 

**Criteria:** **Processing of Criminal Date** 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** Processors of criminal data do not need official authorisation. 

**EU GDPR**: Processors of criminal data do need official authorisation. 

**Criteria:** **Maximum Fine Imposed** 

**DPA 2018/UK GDPR:** The maximum fine for non-compliance is £17.5 million, with no annual turnover comparability.

**EU GDPR**: The maximum fine for non-compliance is €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.  

### **What are the GDPR Principles?** 

There are seven principles that are core to GDPR– (these are outlined in Article 5 of the legislation) – which have been designed to guide how individuals’ data can be handled. The principles are largely the same as those that existed previously under data protection laws. 

**GDPR’s seven principles are:** 

1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
2. Purpose limitation
3. Data minimisation
4. Accuracy
5. Storage limitation
6. Integrity and confidentiality (security)
7. Accountability

In reality, only one of these principles – accountability – is new. In the UK, all the other principles are similar to those that existed under the 1998 Data Protection Act. 

In the next step you will explore the Human Rights Act 1998 and how that might affect personal data protection.
