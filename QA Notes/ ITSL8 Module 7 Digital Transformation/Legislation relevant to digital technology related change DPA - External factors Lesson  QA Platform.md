The UK's third generation of Data Protection Law received Royal Assent and its main provisions commenced on the 25th of May 2018 known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR.

This new act modernized data protection laws to ensure that they're future proofed.

The UK's Data Protection Act, DPA 2018 complements GDPR and updates the 1998 DPA.

It makes provisions about processing personal data and creates a complete data protection system.

As well as governing general data covered by GDPR, the DPA covers all other general data, law enforcement data and national security data.

Furthermore, the act exercises a number of agreed modifications to GDPR to make it work for the benefit of the UK in areas such as academic research, financial services and child protection.

GDPR has a direct effect across all EU member states and has already been passed.

Organizations that are not based in the EU but operate within it must comply with it.

This means organizations still have to comply with this regulation and still have to look to GDPR for most legal obligations.

However, GDPR gives member states limited opportunities to make provisions for how it applies in their country.

The DPA 2018 updates data protection laws in the UK, supplementing General Data Protection Regulation, EU 2016/679 and implementing the EU Law Enforcement Directive as well as extending data protection laws to areas which are not covered by GDPR.

It is intended to provide a comprehensive package to protect personal data.

The DPA 2018 has a section dealing with processing that does not fall within the EU law. For example, where it is related to emigration. It applies GDPR standards but it has been amended to adjust those that would not work in the national context.

It also has a part that transposes the EU Data Protection Directive 2016/680, Law Enforcement Directive into domestic UK law. The directive compliments GDPR and part three of the DPA 2018 sets out the requirements for the processing of personal data for criminal law enforcement purposes. National security is also outside the scope of EU law. The government has decided that it's important that intelligence services are required to comply with internationally recognized, data protection standards.

So there are provisions based on Council of Europe Data Protection Convention 108 that apply to them. There are also separate parts to cover the information commissioners, offices, duties, functions and powers along with enforcement provisions.

The Data Protection Act 1998 is being repealed so the updated DPA makes the changes necessary to deal with the interaction between the DPA 2018 and other legislation such as Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulation.
