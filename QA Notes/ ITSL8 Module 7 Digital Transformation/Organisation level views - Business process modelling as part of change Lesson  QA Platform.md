We can view an organisation from different perspectives. This helps us to see different aspects of the enterprise which can be valuable in building up our understanding. 

- Functional view
- Organisation chart view
- Process view

### Functional View of an Organisation 

![Organisational chart:  Top line = General Management. Second line = Engineering, Production, Accounts, Marketing, Sales and Support.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid1-5d8980a5-349e-4f41-9733-a057c84d20f4.png)

**Figure 1:** Example of a functional organisational chart.

In the past, we have organised our businesses and the work they do in a manner that is most convenient for the people in the business, not for the customer. We’ve typically organised around the premise that those people who do the same sort of work should be co-located so all the accountants work together, all the IT people work together, and all the salespeople work together. 

These disciplinary groups do not perform business processes. However, they perform functions *within* business processes. Such groupings are called departments. Potentially, the activities they carry out are fragmented, leading to multiple ‘hand-offs’ and ‘black holes’: 

- **Hand off** - Passing ‘product’ from one to another.
- **Black Hole** - Losing ‘product’ along route - poor tracking.

### **Organisation Chart View**

Their departments are then detailed in the following rows.](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid3-e6efa9e3-a24b-4844-bff9-43a780791ab8.png)

**Figure 2:** Example of an organisational chart view.

The organisation chart is based on the functional view of the organisation and provides further detail to show: 

- Individual roles
- Formal reporting and communication lines within each functional area

The functional and organisation chart views do *not* show elements such as: 

- External factors that affect the organisation.
- How the organisation responds to requests from customers.
- How the various departments interact with each other.

What these views don’t show is how the organisation works when handling a request from a customer, for example. 

### **Process View**  

A business process begins with a request from an internal or external customer and proceeds through activities until the requested product or service is delivered (and paid for).

### **Functional vs Process View** 

- True business processes often involve multiple functions or departments.
- The ‘silo’ effect can often present in organisations structured in a functional hierarchy. Business staff working in one area may focus solely on the work they carry out and fail to appreciate aspects of the end-to-end process as a whole:
- who the customer is and what their perception may be.
- whether the work they do aligns with tasks carried out by other departments either earlier or later in the process.
- Processes are horizontal rather than vertical.

- They start with a request for a product or service from a customer (either internal or external) and end with the delivery of (and payment for) that product or service, by a satisfied customer.
- Processes are independent of organisation structure – structure defines how the people in the business are **organised** to carry out the processes.
- The process view focuses on what we are in business to do from our customer’s perspective.

### **Advantages of the Process View** 

Remember that: 

- Processes create value for a customer.
- Processes provide someone who cares with what they expect to receive.
- Processes are how an organisation delivers its products and services to its customers.

Essentially, the business needs both views – i.e., a holistic view of process and a view of organisation structure. Our customers don’t care how our organisation is structured, just what we deliver and how well we deliver it.  

In the next step you will now explore the enterprise level process model.
