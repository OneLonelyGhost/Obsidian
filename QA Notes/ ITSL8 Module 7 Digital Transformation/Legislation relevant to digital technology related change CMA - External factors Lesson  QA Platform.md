The Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is a great example of legislation being created to deal with a problem that had not been foreseen.

Hacking has been around since the dawn of mass communications and became more of a problem from the 1960s onwards as computers became more interconnected around the globe. This greatest spread of computer technologies and connectivity saw technically savvy individuals and groups deliberately setting out to break into computer systems for both the challenge and in some cases profit.

Prior to the CMA there was no specific legislation in place, under which UK based hackers could be prosecuted. One of the first attempts to prosecute hackers in the UK saw two individuals, charged under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, for defrauding BT by manufacturing a false instrument. Once the pair were found guilty and fined their subsequent appeal was successful and they were acquitted.

This case led to the drafting of the CMA. The CMA comprises four main offenses, unauthorized access to computer material. This is the lowest level of offense and is one that many of us might be guilty of at some stage in our lives.

If someone found or guessed a password belonging to someone else then by looking at their files you are guilty of accessing materials without authorization. This offense carries the risk of being sentenced to six months in prison and/or a hefty fine.Â 

Unauthorized access with intent to commit a crime. The difference here is that access is sought with the intent to commit a crime. Phishing emails where someone else seeks to obtain bank details to steal money would be covered by this part of the Act.

Unauthorized modification of computer material. This offense relates to the deletion or changes made to files with the intent to cause damage to an individual or company. This offense also covers purposely introducing viruses to other people's systems. If you knowingly transmit a virus to others you are guilty under this section of the Computer Misuse Act.

Making, supplying or obtaining material: Making, this includes the writing or creation of computer viruses, worms, Trojans, malware, malicious scripts, et cetera. Supplying: It is an offense to supply or distribute these files to others. Obtaining: If you purposely obtain malicious files, then you have committed an offense, under the Computer Misuse Act.
