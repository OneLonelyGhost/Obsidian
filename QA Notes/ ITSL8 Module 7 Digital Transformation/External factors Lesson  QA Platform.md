### What external factors you need to consider

When organisations start a digital transformation strategy and programme it’s key to analyse the external environment within which digital transformation activity is to take place. There are many available approaches to performing this external factors analysis one of which is Porter’s five forces model, which is particularly helpful when evaluating for competition in an environment.  

Another approach is the use of PESTLE analysis, which, given its broad coverage, helps to identify and categorise factors influencing or constraining how an organisation operates.  

**PESTLE:** External analysis factors and their influence on a digital strategy.

**P = Political** 

The influence of governments through policies (tax, fiscal, trade, labour, state ownership, etc.), stability, level of corruption, openness to influence, available subsidies, etc. For example, in the UK the social media app TikTok has been banned on government electronic devices due to concerns around sensitive information being accessed and used by some other platforms.  

**E = Economic**  

Factors determining the performance of an economy, such as inflation, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, demand/supply models, foreign investment, unemployment rates, and consumer purchasing power. Economic fluctuations may affect affordability of consumer technologies; commoditisation and adoption of technology solutions are closely related to the costs of provision and consumption. 

**S = Social**  

A population’s culture, attitudes, norms, values, demographics (such as age, income, location, and language), buying trends, mobility, etc. Social movements for or against certain technology solutions, their vendors, or their countries of origin may change the technology adoption overnight. 

**T = Technological**  

The level and impact of technology innovation, including focus on research and development, attitude to innovation and technology, incentives to use innovative technology, automation, etc. Technology innovations affect existing solutions, sometimes by quickly replacing them completely. 

**L = Legal**  

Linked to political, but specifically legislation rather than policy, including laws related to discrimination, competition, employment, consumer protection, copyright and patents, and health and safety. Legislation regulating data processing, privacy and other information-related matters may limit, prohibit, or endorse the adoption and development of certain technologies. 

**E = Environmental**  

Constraints or enablers linked to the availability (or scarcity) of natural resources, geography, climate, and pollution and carbon footprint targets. Environmental factors, especially disastrous ones, may interrupt or stimulate operation and adoption of certain technologies.
