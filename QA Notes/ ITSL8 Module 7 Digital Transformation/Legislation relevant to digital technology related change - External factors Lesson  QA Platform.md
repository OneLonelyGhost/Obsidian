There are many aspects of legislation that need to be considered as part of any digital transformation activity. We start by looking at the Data protection Act 2018. 

### **Data Protection Act 2018**  

Digital technology has had a huge impact on the way the data is collected, processed, stored, and communicated.  

On 23 May 2018, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) was implemented in the UK. This updated Act addressed the impact and influence of the digital age and empowered individuals to take control of their data. The DPA 2018 was also set up to ensure that the UK was safeguarded, post Brexit, once separated from the European Union. 

Under the Data Protection Act 2018, you have the right to find out what information organisations and the government store about you.

**Your rights under the Data Protection Act 2018** 

- Get and use your data for different services - data portability.
- Object to how your data is processed in certain circumstances.
- Stop or restrict the processing of your data.
- Information about how your data is being used.
- Have data erased.
- Access personal data.
- Automated decision-making processes and for profiling. \*
- Have incorrect data update.

\* You also have rights when an organisation uses your personal data for non-human involvement in any automated decision-making and profiling, for example when your data can be used to predict trends and behaviour in shopping habits or preferences. 

In the next step you will look at a UK GDPR and EU GDPR.
