## Principles of business change

Organisations can be represented as a set of business processes. Business processes are the activities that they perform in order to achieve their business goals. The organisation will use business components, such as people, organisation, information, and technology to support these processes.  

This is often described as the POPIT model. 

Business change can involve changes to any or all business components, and in the context of digital transformation, it typically will involve all aspects of the POPIT model.

Organisations should make business changes that support the needs of the business and the business strategy. Many organisations develop programmes of strategic change that move an organisation from its current state, often referred to as “As-is”, to a desired future state, often referred to as “To-be”. To do this successfully, organisations must be clear how these changes will affect the processes, people, organisation, information, and technology within the business.  ![2 x POPIT triangles one labelled ‘As-is’ linked by a strategy cloud and business change arrow pointing towards the second triangle labelled ‘To-be’.​](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid4-034dd9c9-c351-4d77-a967-1b27b6949586.png)

### **The Degrees of Business Change** 

Venkatraman’s model can be used to classify the degree of change; it recognises the necessity, by some means, of defining a ‘small’ change as opposed to a ‘large’ change. 

#### **Level**: 1

**Type:** Evolutionary 

**Change target:** Localised Exploitation

**Example:** Deployment of individual systems, e.g. sales support system 

#### **Level:** 2

**Type:** Evolutionary

**Change target:** Internal Integration 

**Example:** Use of IT across a business process. Replacement of an existing system by an additional ERP module 

#### **Level:** 3

**Type:** Revolutionary 

**Change target:** Business Process Re-design 

Example: Re-engineer a part of the business, e.g. order fulfilment

#### **Level:** 4

**Type:** Revolutionary 

**Change target:** Business Process Re-design 

**Example:** Changes in suppliers or the contracts that exist, e.g. just-in-time deliveries 

#### **Level:** 5

**Type:** Revolutionary 

**Change target:** Business Scope Re-definition 

**Example:** Enter a new marketplace

Change may range from a small incremental enhancement, building on what is there already, to a major re-engineering programme.  

Changing the scope of the business, including entering a new marketplace, is the most demanding level of change according to Venkatraman.  

### **The Business Change Lifecycle**

![Flow chart diagram showing the change lifecycle: Business case is central surrounding that are steps: Definition, design, implementation, realisation, alignment. Linked to alignment are enterprise architecture, business environment and business strategy](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/entity/blobid6-408478a3-6f6e-4dc2-81f6-539cd53e4989.png)

#### **Mnemonic ADDIR** 

Over the last few years many organisations have recognised that *standalone* IT projects are not the answer to their changing business needs. What they need are **business change programmes,** delivered via digital transformation programmes which incorporate digital technology changes at their core.  

These programmes require individuals with specific skills to be positioned in roles established to support business change. 

The early part of the lifecycle is concerned with the analysis of the organisation, and its business needs, in order to determine more effective and efficient ways of working.   

Later activities are about change, design, development, business acceptance testing and, following implementation, benefits review and realisation.

### **The Stages in the Business Change Lifecycle** 

#### **Alignment** 

Alignment involves ensuring that the organisation’s objectives and strategy are aligned with the external business world, and that proposed changes align with internal policies and architectures.  

Strategy links the organisation to its external environment. As the environment changes, the organisation must adapt.

To determine where it is going, the organisation needs to know exactly where it stands, then determine where it wants to go, and how it will get there. The resulting output is called the ‘strategic plan’.

While strategic planning may be used to effectively plot a company’s longer-term direction, one cannot use it to reliably forecast how the market will evolve and what issues will surface in the immediate future. Therefore, strategic innovation and constant review and adjustment of the ‘strategic plan’ have to be a cornerstone strategy for an organisation to survive the turbulent business climate.

#### **Definition**  

Definition means taking a closer look at a proposed business situation in order to uncover root causes of problems, conduct a thorough analysis, recommend relevant, feasible changes, and define the requirements.

The definition phase is about defining the elements that will support the change. This includes starting to build a list of high-level business requirements.

One very important artefact from any technology\-driven business change activity is the production and use of a ‘Business Case’ – it is the heart of successful digitally\-driven business change and should be a constant reminder of what benefits are to be achieved and how to track the realisation of them.

#### **Design** 

Design refers to the detailed specification, development, and testing of the solution, including the business process and related tasks, and the digital technology that is needed to support them.  

#### **Implementation** 

Implementation is the planning and preparation for the deployment of the business changes.  

Throughout this stage, the change team has a major influence on how the implementation goes ahead. We need to ensure that the changes are delivered in a professional manner. Involving key stakeholders can help ensure that the message gets to all relevant staff so that they are prepared for activities as they happen. Learning as we go and adapting the plan as appropriate is important, as is ensuring that all the staff are trained. We need to deal with practical issues as they arise.  

#### **Realisation** 

The review of the predicted benefits, including identifying benefits that have been achieved and taking further action to achieve those still in progress.

Once the solution has moved into the real world, we have to reassure ourselves and the stakeholders that the changes implemented have been successful (or not!) and have delivered the degree of benefit originally intended.
