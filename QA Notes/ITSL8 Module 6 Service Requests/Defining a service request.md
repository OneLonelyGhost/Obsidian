## **What is a service request?**

A service request is anything that's not an incident, a problem, or a normal change. 

Rarely does a user contact the service desk to say ‘Please can an engineer look at my laptop/desktop/application, it appears to have stopped working!’. They are more likely to say, ‘my X has stopped working, please can an engineer …’. It’s a subtle use of English, but it is quite an important distinction.

Conversely, if a user wants a new mouse, a new laptop, some advice, access to a new system, or even a simple password change, then they are more amenable with their use of language, knowing that potentially the service desk analyst could decline. So, they usually place the word ‘Please’ at the forefront of the sentence. ‘Please can I get a new mouse’, ‘Please can I order a new laptop’, ‘Please could you help me with…’, ‘Please can you give me access to…’, or even ‘Please can you show me how I change my password’.

Generally, anything low cost, low risk and where the authority has already been pre-given, is a service request.

However, if the request needs authority, then it might be a change request, or your organisation may still consider this to be a service request. It’s very subtle and down to the organisation itself to define. 

**Let’s consider an example:**

A user contacts the service desk and informs them that there is a new starter joining the organisation at the beginning of the next calendar month. This gives the desk a lead time of one month. There is a standard ‘request’ template/model for a new starter that is low risk and regularly repeated.

However, the new starter is joining the security team and will therefore need a higher level of access than a usual starter, and a ‘non-standard’ laptop. The laptop is to be cross charged to the security department and the access levels verified by the Security manager. 

**Are these service requests or requests for change?**

**Example 1:** A user phones the service desk and states that they have tried to log into their system three times and now the account is locked. Please can the service desk unlock the account?

**Example 2:** Another user on the same system rings a few minutes later and states that they have incorrectly typed in their password twice and know that the next error will cause the account to be locked, please could the service desk change the password to reset the account?

The correct answer is: It’s up to your organisation. However, in service management best practice:

**Example 1:** This is a service request. The user is already locked out and even though it is their fault, it is still an unplanned interruption to the service, hence it is an incident.

**Example 2:** This user has not yet locked their account, so it is a service request to change the password.

It’s extremely subtle on the margins, but that should not divert any organisation from creating and documenting exactly what a service desk analyst/agent should do with a service request.

The definition of a service request in best practice is:

> 'A request from a user or a user’s authorised representative that initiates a service action which has been agreed as a normal part of service delivery.'

A service request is anything miscellaneous that's not an incident, a problem, or a normal change. The service desk provides the communication channel for service requests, but the service request management practice is a channel for any request that's low cost, low risk, and pre-authorised and can be completed by any member of any team.

### **Change**

Sometimes a service request is not a normal change. So, what is a normal change?

This module focusses on service request management, but intrinsically this means there is a link to change management, or, as many best practice frameworks now call it, change enablement. Basically, for the past twenty years it could be argued that changes are poorly named, but the naming convention has stuck, and thus many organisations use the same terminology. Most organisations use three or more change categories:

1. Emergency
2. Normal
3. Standard

**Emergency changes** are required to be implemented urgently, or in an emergency.

The other two categories are not quite so straight forward.

**Normal change** needs assessment and authorisation by the recognised change authority – the individual or group who hold the ‘scope of control’ for that change. This type of change is frequently discussed at a change advisory board (CAB) before a decision is made. Normal changes are frequently given subcategories of minor, significant, and major.

**Standard change** has already been considered, assessed, and ‘pre-authorised’. In other words, the change authority has permitted that if a change is raised by a user, providing the person receiving the request considers it to be ‘low cost, low risk, regularly repeatable’, then the decision to permit or decline can be taken by someone other than themselves.

This may of course sound very familiar, as this is almost word-for-word a description of a service request. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a standard change and a service request are the same. So, whenever an organisation talks of standard changes, they are also simultaneously talking about service request models, and thus service requests.
