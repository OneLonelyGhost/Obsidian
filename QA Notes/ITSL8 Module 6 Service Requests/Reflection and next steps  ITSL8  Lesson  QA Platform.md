## Submit your reflection

Complete a reflection statement, including answering the key performance questions, to embed what you have taken away. You will submit your reflection statement on Bud. You should also submit any other classroom evidence as guided by your tutor.

Answering these first three bullets below will provide evidence of your ongoing meta-skills:

- What are they key things you have learnt?
- When you return to your workplace, what will you start and stop doing, and why?
- How will you know that you have been successful?

Now please answer the following knowledge questions which relate to your SQA unit for this module. Write at least one relevant paragraph per question.

You should include screenshots from your Practise learning resources (with your tutor), to help you contextualise your answers to the questions below. This should help you to contribute the expected standards of evidence overall for your qualification.

1. Describe how to provide remote and on-premises service request support, including comparisons and contrasts.
2. Demonstrate what is meant by triaging services, and how important SLAs are in a service desk environment.
3. Describe what first line service requests could be, and when they become complicated enough to require escalation in line with standard organisational procedures.
4. Demonstrate what is meant by using monitoring software and analytical tools to identify trends and tools to provide proactive support and reduce reactive support requests.

You should write and save your reflection statement as a Word (\*.docx) document or similar.

### Submitting your work

Please follow these steps to submit your work: 

1. Return to Bud.
2. In your **Activity** window, select the **Messages and Submissions** button.
3. Upload your reflection statement as a Word (\*.docx) file or similar.
4. Select the **Submit** button.

You can upload more than one document, but you must upload all the documents in one go, before you select the **Submit** button.

Once you have submitted your work, your DLC will be in touch with you and mark your activity as **complete.**
