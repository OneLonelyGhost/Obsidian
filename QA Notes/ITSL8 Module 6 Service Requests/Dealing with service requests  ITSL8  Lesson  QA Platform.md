## The service request management process

Once an organisation has defined what constitutes a service request and mapped the activities relating to fulfilment or declination of that request, the organisation has, by definition, effectively created the service request management process.

It could be useful at this point to create a process model/map that any new service requests could ‘drop’ into, in order to drive effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of service request management in any organisation.

The process diagram in **Figure 1** is a suggested process based on best practice. It is not designed to be the ‘de facto’ process. Any organisation should and could create their own process based upon their market space, industry sector, and business vision and goals. The documented process is designed as a discussion start point and additions, modifications, and subtractions should be considered.

**Figure 1**: Service request management process flow chart.

In this process, a user/representative contacts and asks, ‘Please can….’. The team representative creates a service request ticket or assesses the ticket received. They ask themselves ‘Is this a request?’

If no, an incident/problem or change ticket is created and the relevant process followed.  

If yes, the ticket is categorised and prioritised. Then, the service desk team representative compares the request against known models. If a model doesn’t exist for this request, the request is considered, and the team representative considers if they have the ‘scope of control’ to fulfil the request.                                                                

If yes, the request is fulfilled or declined as appropriate. The user confirms their satisfaction, the ticket is closed, and a new service request model is created.

If no, the request is escalated to the individual with the scope of control to decide. The request is passed back to the team representative for completion, the user confirms satisfaction, the ticket is closed, and a new service request model is created.
