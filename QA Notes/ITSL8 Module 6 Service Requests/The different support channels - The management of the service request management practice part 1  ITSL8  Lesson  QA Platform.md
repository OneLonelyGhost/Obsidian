There are a variety of support/contact channels that can be used, utilised, and sadly in some cases abused by users.

**Figure 1** shows the array of contact channels available for support in many organisations.

**Figure 1**: Service desk contact channels.

Let’s take a look at each one in more detail.

**Phone calls**

The traditional, and one may consider ‘old fashioned’ method of raising service requests is by telephone. This method of raising requests is often discouraged in most organisations today as the verbal creation of requests requires considerable manual efforts. The service desk analysts must be physically there to discuss the request with the user, then after interpreting the request, that information needs to be typed/inputted into a ticket before any steps are taken to address and fulfil the request. 

For years, if not decades, there has been a push to create ‘quick calls’ or quick tickets where a single button can be selected on the system display screen to create an entire log/ticket without the necessity to fill in multiple fields. A common use of this is a password change. This option trumps those in the support teams, resistant to create support tickets on the grounds that it takes longer to create the ticket than fulfil it - so they can help three customers or create one ticket.

**Online chat and Chatbots**

Online chat was the new kid on the block until artificial intelligence (AI) and Chatbot technology came into support environments. The ability to talk to a user through text rather than verbally helps those users who feel anxious or uncomfortable using the telephone. For the user this can be very beneficial. For the service provider it can also be beneficial as they can potentially deal with multiple users simultaneously. That said, the ticket creation still relies upon manual activities. 

Within the past few years, Chatbots have become standard. Utilising machine learning and AI technology systems can now interpret vocal instructions from users. These Chatbots can identify a request over an incident and will auto-populate a ticket and escalate from the first line to an analyst or engineer as appropriate.

**Email**

Many organisations accept requests via email, and whilst this is diminishing, there are several older employees for whom email is the standard communication tool. Unless the organisation has created request templates within the mail client, service desk staff will need to manually cut and paste the information from the email into a request ticket. They will then potentially need to reach out to the user for any additional or missing information. This not only delays the completion of the request, but reduces efficiency as there is an unnecessary time and resource usage ‘double-handling’ the same information.

**Online portal services**

Organisations moving away from email have in the past few years taken advantage of service management toolsets that enable users to self-create tickets. This is usually achieved by asking users to complete their incident or change request using a self-service portal.

The portal often has a generic front page for ticket creation and the user opts for incident, change, or service request by means of a drop-down menu selection. As soon as the ticket type is selected, the fields required for that category of ticket appear upon the screen for the user to complete. This maximises the efficiency of those on the desk relating to service requests. However, care has to be taken in how much free-text users are allowed to enter. There is a potential overhead from someone quality-checking the tickets to ensure that quality data relating to the request can be obtained and manipulated to recognise common themes, and root causes of problems.

**Corporate social media**

Linking into the self-service portal is the opportunity to contact the service desk and raise requests via social media. This was at the forefront of development a few years ago, but self-service portals and smaller apps have taken much of the business/social media development away.

That said, some small to mid-scale organisations may allow users to raise service requests via social media. This takes advantage of the sites for connectivity and communication, allowing the service provider to focus on the user outcomes. This solution can be effective, though is rarely efficient and the reliance on a third party for communication with users can sometimes be a risk to great for an organisation.

**Mobile**

Another support channel gaining popularity is a mobile option. This is especially popular where organisations have hubs of employees or physical office buildings in various cities or locations within the same city. Effectively saying, for example, ‘we have a support team in your building on Tuesday between 8am and 6pm to answer questions, raise requests, and to deal with any of those little issues that have been bugging you’.

The mobile support team ensures that the face-to-face communication benefits are maintained, whilst simultaneously allowing users to ask the ‘silly’ questions they feel embarrassed to contact the service desk about. As a result, it reduces the burden on the service desk, allowing them to focus on incidents or service requests from users not able to wait until the mobile support team visits. There is a hybrid between mobile and ‘walk-in’ support teams.

**Walk-in**

Another, and perhaps the most abused support option is the walk-up/walk-in/shoulder touch, in other words ‘I was just passing and thought I’d ask if you could…’

Whilst contact between users and the service desk should continue to be championed, consideration should also be given to allowing users to speak face-to-face with the service desk. It builds relationships and credibility, but it is hard for the service desk agents to prioritise a telephone caller or a chat call over someone physically present.

Human instinct is simply to deal with the person physically present as opposed to those in the queue, who can wait a few minutes longer. This may be viewed as unfair – it means that those within the vicinity of the service desk team get a priority service compared to those remote workers. This might mean that a remote worker with an incident is held up, whilst the local user’s request gets fulfilled.

**Hybrid – tech bar**

Higher education and now many businesses have come up with a hybrid model between walk-in support and mobile support. It is now common to be able to book an appointment to visit a support team. This tech-bar/genius-bar/support-bar model is the best of both worlds.

This option facilitates face-to-face communications, and the relationship building associated with physical communication. The booking mechanism also ensures capacity to deal with users in a timely fashion whilst not penalising those users not within the locality.

This hybrid model can be used with both the walk-in option and the mobile support channel option, but does of course, rely upon having a tool or having the facility with the support tooling to create an appointment booking service.
