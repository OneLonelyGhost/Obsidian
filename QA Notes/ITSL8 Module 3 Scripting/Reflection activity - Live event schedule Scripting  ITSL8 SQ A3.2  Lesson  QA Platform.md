Complete a reflection statement, including answering the key performance questions, to embed what you have taken away. You will submit your reflection statement on Bud. You should also submit any other classroom evidence as guided by your tutor.

Answering these first three bullets below will provide evidence of your ongoing meta-skills:

- What are they key things you have learnt?
- When you return to your workplace, what will you start and stop doing, and why?
- How will you know that you have been successful?

Now please answer the following performance questions which relate to your SQA unit for this module. Write at least one relevant paragraph per question. You should include screenshots from your Practise learning resources (with your tutor) to help you contextualise your answers to the questions below. This should help you to contribute the expected standards of evidence overall for your qualification.

1. Identify common requirements for batch scripts and stakeholders.
2. Describe how to create a batch script for a particular task in line with standard organisational requirements.
3. Describe the standard requirements to cover when testing batch files.
4. Describe how to document batch scripts to support future maintenance.
5. Demonstrate how to deploy and execute standard batch scripts.
6. Describe how to review batch scripts to confirm they perform correctly.

You should write and save your reflection statement as a Word (\*.docx) document or similar.
