It's been a pleasure having another Byte Session with you, this time on PowerShell. To finish up this course, I'd like to review some of the key takeaways.

PowerShell uses cmdlets to perform operations although native system commands are allowed. You can use PowerShell interactively at the shell prompt or by using scripts as you will see in the final Lab Step in the PowerShell Byte Session Lab.

PowerShell gives several built-in ways for getting help, including the Get-Help cmdlet with its various parameters, a comprehensive autocompletion system, and a cmdlet alias system to help you get started with PowerShell when you already know other shells. PowerShell pipelines are a powerful way to chain commands together and preserve the structure of the underlying objects.

What we've seen in this course has given you a solid foundation for continuing to learn about PowerShell. You shouldn't hesitate to try Labs on Cloud Academy that require prior PowerShell experience or to use PowerShell in your own work. The course ends here, but there is one more bonus step in the Lab that covers a few topics that you will see in other Labs using PowerShell, namely variables, scripts, and functions.Â 

Definitely continue on in the Lab to learn about those and how they can help you reuse and share your PowerShell code. And that's all for this course. Until next time, I'm Logan Rakai with Cloud Academy.
